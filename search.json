    "text": "“The musical tradition of the universal Church is a treasure of inestimable value, greater even than that of any other art. The main reason for this pre-eminence is that, as sacred song united to the words, it forms a necessary or integral part of the solemn liturgy.”\n\n✠ Sacrosanctum concilium, 112\n\n\nWhen, in our music, God is glorified,\nAnd adoration leaves no room for pride,\nIt is as though the whole creation cried:\nAlleluia!\nSo has the Church, in liturgy and song,\nIn faith and love, through centuries of wrong,\nBorne witness to the truth in ev’ry tongue:\nAlleluia!\n\nThe text of Fred Pratt Green’s well-known hymn “When in Our Music God is Glorified” beautifully captures the high esteem in which sacred music is held within the Catholic Church, and why. Though Pratt Green was not Catholic himself (the hymn was originally written for the Presbyterian church in England in 1972 (Hawn 2013)), the theology captured by the Methodist poet’s prose harmonizes closely with that of several important Catholic documents. This reality speaks to the universality, centrality, and shared understanding of music within the larger Christian church around the world, even while other theological debates prevail. In his encyclical Mediator Dei (MD; “On the Sacred Liturgy”), Pius XII (1947) proclaims regarding sacred music:\n\nIt is not merely a question of recitation or of singing which, however perfect according to norms of music and the sacred rites, only reaches the ear, but it is especially a question of the ascent of the mind and heart to God so that, united with Christ, we may completely dedicate ourselves and all our actions to Him (MD, 145).\n\nIndeed, this is the sole purpose of music in the liturgy: that it may inspire all of creation to worship and glorify God, in profound adoration, and ascend to Him in mind and heart to be united in the truth of Christ’s sacrifice on the altar. Alleluia!\nPraying through song is a very Jewish practice wherein the Catholic liturgy finds its roots. Scholarly consensus is that the Book of Psalms, also called the Psalter, is a collection of songs routinely used in Jewish worship, though how they were sung has been lost to history in the absence of musical notation in antiquity. (“Psalter” comes from the Greek “Psalterion,” the string-instrument used for the accompaniment of songs or psalms.) For Jesus, as a Jew, to pray the psalms was to sing the psalms, as he does numerous times throughout the Gospels. The psalter contains songs of glory and praise, supplication and thanksgiving, suffering and lamentation. They capture every emotion, occasion, and aspect of the human experience, from the most joyful to the most agonizing. Thusly does Pratt Green’s hymn go on:\n\nAnd did not Jesus sing a psalm that night\nWhen utmost evil strove against the light?\nThen let us sing, for whom he won the fight:\nAlleluia!\n\nWhen the Church sings psalms during Mass, the Liturgy of the Hours, or at just about every other liturgical celebration to this day, she does so in fidelity to how those same ancient songs were prayed by Jesus himself.\nThe Catholic Church has always held sacred music in high esteem and, especially since the Second Vatican Council, has advocated for the participation of the faithful in music at Mass and other liturgical celebrations. Truth be told, however, one could compellingly argue that Protestant denominations have perfected what the Catholic Church professes in the musical arena. It is hardly uncommon in many mainstream Protestant churches—including the most liturgical denominations whose worship traditions remain similar to those of the Catholic Church—to find everyone with an open hymnal singing wholeheartedly to the best of their ability with the voice God gave them, through every verse of every song without complaint, even breaking out into four part harmony. Compare that to the average Catholic congregation, especially in Western English-speaking cultures! Yet the Catholic Church, in the Second Vatican Council’s “Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy,” Sacrosanctum concilium (SD), calls for just that: “[W]henever the sacred action is to be celebrated with song, the whole body of the faithful may be able to contribute that active participation which is rightly theirs” ((Paul VI 1963, 114, emphasis added)).\nThe Church recognizes and has acknowledged this unfortunate disconnect between profession and practice. Pope Pius XII did not mince words when he wrote,\n\nIndeed it is very necessary that the faithful attend the sacred ceremonies not as if they were outsiders or mute onlookers, but let them fully appreciate the beauty of the liturgy and take part in the sacred ceremonies, alternating their voices with the priest and the choir, according to the prescribed norms (MD, 192).\n\nAlthough he was addressing the Mass as a whole, the statement certainly includes music, for:\n\n[a] congregation that is devoutly present at the sacrifice, in which our Savior together with His children redeemed with His sacred blood sings the nuptial hymn of His immense love, cannot keep silent, for “song befits the lover” and, as the ancient saying has it, “he who sings well prays twice.”\n\nAnd if that was not sufficiently clear, Pius also exhorted music ministers “to promote with care congregational singing, and to see to its accurate execution with all due dignity, since it easily stirs up and arouses the faith and piety of large gatherings of the faithful” (MD, 192). Fifteen years later, Pope Paul VI reaffirmed this directive in SC (118):\n\nReligious singing by the people is to be intelligently fostered so that in devotions and sacred exercises, as also during liturgical services, the voices of the faithful may ring out according to the norms and requirements of the rubrics.\n\nClearly, the active singing participation of the people in the pews is important!\nTo be fair, Catholic parishes that have truly taken these teachings to heart do exist—and how wonderful and refreshing it is to find one! Nevertheless, in the majority of English-speaking parishes, much work remains to be done, both in terms of the quality of music provided and the active participation in the music. Herein lies the commendable responsibility of music ministers, instrumentalists, song leaders (cantors), and choir members alike. The humble Catholic music minister will admit that much can be learned from our Protestant brethren. Differences in theology and practices do still exist, however, and Catholic Tradition must be understood and respected, and “the treasure of sacred music…preserved and fostered with great care” (SC, 114).\nThis “treasure of sacred music” is vast and rich, and giving it due justice is well beyond the scope of the present reflection. Within this trove are everything from Gregorian chant to polyphony, from four-part choir anthems to more recent songs by contemporary composers. Despite recent debates on the appropriateness of contemporary music in Catholic liturgy, MD (193) confirms that\n\n[i]t cannot be said that modern music and singing should be entirely excluded from Catholic worship. For, if they are not profane nor unbecoming to the sacredness of the place and function, and do not spring from a desire of achieving extraordinary and unusual effects, then our churches must admit them since they can contribute in no small way to the splendor of the sacred ceremonies, can lift the mind to higher things and foster true devotion of soul.\n\nBecause different types of music inspire different people, parish repertoires should ideally include some of everything, where and when appropriate, and as long as it deemed suitable for Catholic worship. Discernment and informed scrutiny are necessary: not every song that mentions God is sacred. SC (121) explains that “texts intended to be sung must always be in conformity with Catholic doctrine; indeed they should be drawn chiefly from holy scripture and from liturgical sources.” (This is why so-called “pop culture” songs are never appropriate within Catholic liturgy.) Indeed, the Church encourages composers\n\nfilled with the Christian spirit…[to] produce compositions which have the qualities proper to genuine sacred music, not confining themselves to works which can be sung only by large choirs, but providing also for the needs of small choirs and for the active participation of the entire assembly of the faithful (SC, 121).\n\nDiligent attention must also be given to how liturgical music is performed. Cantors must be comfortable leading congregational singing, as this is precisely their role. “Choirs must be diligently promoted” (SC, 114) when and where appropriate. People are more inclined to join in singing if they hear others singing around them; thus, strong, well-trained choirs have the potential to be just as effective, if not more so, than cantors at encouraging congregational singing. The choice of instrument must also be carefully considered. The Roman Catholic (i.e., Latin) Church holds the pipe organ in “high esteem, for it is the traditional musical instrument which adds a wonderful splendor to the Church’s ceremonies and powerfully lifts up man’s mind to God and to higher things” (SC, 120). While other instruments are permitted, it must be ensured that they “are suitable, or can be made suitable, for sacred use, accord with the dignity of the temple, and truly contribute to the edification of the faithful” (SC, 120). For example, an acoustic guitar may be sufficient for a small group gathering, but wholly inadequate for filling a large church with sound. The instrument is not only to lead the cantor; it must lead and inspire the entire congregation.\nSacrosanctum concilium devotes an entire chapter to liturgical music, which opens with the quote preceding this Introduction:\n\nThe musical tradition of the universal Church is a treasure of inestimable value, greater even than that of any other art. The main reason for this pre-eminence is that, as sacred song united to the words, it forms a necessary or integral part of the solemn liturgy. Therefore sacred music is to be considered the more holy in proportion as it is more closely connected with the liturgical action, whether it adds delight to prayer, fosters unity of minds, or confers greater solemnity upon the sacred rites (SC, 112).\n\nThis bold statement is worthy of contemplation. “The musical tradition of the universal Church is…greater even than that of any other art.” Imagine stepping into Saint Peter’s Basilica in Rome—or any other famously ornate cathedral in the world—for the first time and being awestruck by the beauty of the architecture, the frescos, the stained glass windows, the sanctuary. Many a tourist who profess no religious belief or practice admit a certain indescribable “other-worldliness” of the stunning and breathtaking beauty found inside the walls of historic Catholic churches—which is precisely the intended response. The Church claims that as strong a response invoked by these most beautiful works of art, liturgical music should be even more impactful. The stakes are undoubtedly high!\nThe music minister’s role is therefore crucially important. Music must be performed well so as to enhance the liturgy and elevate the minds and hearts of the worshipers. This must not be mistaken for theatrical performance for entertainment; at its core, liturgical music must be worship. The music minister must lead the congregation in such a way as to invite, encourage, and inspire full, conscious, and active participation, that all might\n\n[join] in the hymns of the Church triumphant and with the choirs of angels, and, all together, sing a wondrous and eternal hymn of praise to the most Holy Trinity in keeping with words of the preface, “with whom our voices, too, thou wouldst bid to be admitted” (MD, 192).\n\nAnd equally important, the music minister must ensure that the music is suitable for worship and appropriately selected for the specific celebration. Only in this way can the music fully harmonize with the readings and spoken prayers of the liturgy to create one holistic act of worship worthy of Almighty God.\nThus, to the devoted and dedicated music minister: Go forth, produce beautiful music worthy of our God and inspiring to worshipers, that through your hard work, long hours of planning, practice, and rehearsals behind the scenes, and commitment to enhancing liturgical worship, the Catholic faithful entrusted to your musical care may truly ascend to God in mind and heart, week after week, in full, active, conscious participation. May the beauty of the music you provide surpass that of the most stunningly ornate church. And may the final verse of Fred Pratt Green’s hymn “When In Our Music God is Glorified” ring true in every church every weekend:\n\nLet every instrument be tuned for praise!\nLet all rejoice who have a voice to raise!\nAnd may God give us faith to sing always:\nAlleluia!\n\nIn the words of Pope Pius XII:\n\nLet the full harmonious singing of our people rise to heaven like the bursting of a thunderous sea and let them testify by the melody of their song to the unity of their hearts and minds, as becomes brothers and the children of the same Father (MD, 194).\n\nAnd in the words of the psalmist:\n\nPraise God with the sounding of the trumpet,\npraise him with the harp and lyre,\nPraise him with timbrel and dancing,\npraise him with the strings and pipe,\nPraise him with the clash of cymbals,\npraise him with resounding cymbals.\n(Psalm 150 3-5)\n\nSaint Cecilia, patroness of music and musicians, pray for us!\n\n✠ ✠ ✠\n\n\n\n\n\nHawn, C.

    "text": "Hymn Selection: A Heuristic\nThis booklet contains music selections for all weekend Masses as well as floating Solemnities, Holy Days of Obligations, and other Feasts for which music may be requested. It includes a full three-year cycle (Years A, B, and C) of processional, offertory, communion, meditation, and recessional hymn selections, plus responsorial psalm refrains. Gregorian years are provided for each liturgical year for convenience. Since the liturgical calendar begins on the First Sunday of Advent, usually around the first Sunday in December, each liturgical cycle actually begins about four weeks prior to the Gregorian year listed. For example, liturgical Year A in 2023 begins on the First Sunday of Advent in December 2022.\nEach liturgical season has its own section. The section Feasts and Solemnities contains Sunday solemnities that do not fall on a specific calendar date, solemnities that do fall on specific dates but occur at different points in the liturgical calendar from year to year, and other special feasts for which music either has previously been requested or may be requested in the future. Feasts or solemnities that fall on a Sunday supersede the usual Sunday liturgy, so the music selection for the feast or solemnity should be used on these occasions. Note that when this happens, the Sunday liturgy that was superseded is skipped altogether, not postponed until the next week. It is the responsibility of the music minister to keep abreast of these irregularities in the liturgical calendar and plan ahead accordingly.\nMusic planning for Catholic liturgies is a deliberate process. First and foremost, hymns and songs (hereafter, “songs”) must be suitable for the part of the Mass for which they are being selected. This is one of the most important considerations when planning music, but it is also neglected far too often. For example, processional and recessional hymns, since they accompany processions, can and should be more jubilant or upbeat. This is not only true of the music choice, but how these songs are performed as well. In contrast, communion and meditation hymns are more solemn and reverent. Songs that speak of gathering (“Gather Us In,” for example) only make sense as processional songs and should not be used elsewhere in the Mass, while songs about the Eucharist are well-suited for communion, meditation, and possibly offertory hymns. Using Eucharistic songs as processional or recessional hymns, however popular the song might be (such as “I Am the Bread of Life” or “On Eagle’s Wings”), is rarely appropriate and is strongly discouraged.\nSongs should seldom be selected “at random” and never to accommodate personal preferences. Rather, every hymn should be carefully chosen to suit the particular liturgy. The music schedules herein have been assembled according to the following hierarchical heuristic method:\nAdd color code explanation",

    "text": "Readings: Songs whose texts encapsulate, are based on, or are derived from any of the readings for a particular Mass are given first priority. This includes the first reading, second reading, Gospel, and Gospel acclamation verse. In some cases, the responsorial psalm texts are also echoed in a song selection.\nLiturgical Season: The special Liturgical Seasons—Advent, Christmas, Lent, and Easter—are considered next. All of these seasons have their own songs that are best suited for that season as well as some that are appropriate only during that season. These songs are given precedence over common songs that can be used throughout the rest of the year during Ordinary Time.\nThemes: Every set of Mass readings contains one or more themes that link them together in an intentional way. These themes are often more specific than the broader seasonal themes. These themes are provided in this booklet for every weekend and Solemnity for reference and to provide the music minister with a deeper understanding of that particular celebration and appreciation for its music selection. The vast majority of these theme lists have been taken from Those missing from CanticaNOVA were compiled by M. Grossi.\nAntiphons: Every Mass has a designated entrance and communion antiphon. These were traditionally chanted where hymns have become the norm. Nevertheless, these ancient texts are neither to be forgotten nor ignored, and songs based on or derived from these proper antiphons have been scheduled in the appropriate places. For example, the many songs referencing the Bread of Life can be used when the communion antiphons are taken from the Bread of Life discourses of John 6. Entrance and communion antiphons have been included in this booklet for reference and to reveal the context for many song selections that may otherwise not be obvious.\nMiscellaneous themes: Other events or occasions sometimes warrant being captured in song, even if not directly connected to any of the above criteria. Examples include Marian devotions throughout the months of May and October; special days like the World Day of Peace (January 1); or Mothers’ and Fathers’ Day, which provide opportunities to honor our spiritual Mother and Father in a special way. Relevant music is substituted in as appropriate, but some adjustments may be necessary from year to year since most of these occasions tend to fall on different liturgical weekends each year.",

    "section": "Hymnals",
    "text": "Hymnals\nThe hymnal(s) from which each musical selection is taken are indicated as follows:\n\nBB = “Breaking Bread”\nG = “Gather”\nW = “Worship”\nH = “We Pray in Song” Hymnal\nRA = “Respond & Acclaim”\n\nMultiple abbreviations indicate the song is found in both books and can be taken from either one. In these cases, the music minister is encouraged to consider using only one book per Mass, if possible, to minimize confusion. Some songs are found in both hymnals but are prefaced herein with only one abbreviation. This indicates that either the melodies are different and the chosen melody was more appropriate for the particular part of the Mass, or that the lyrics or translations were different across the two books and there are compelling theological reasons to prefer the one indicated in this booklet. Music ministers are requested to honor these decisions. No prefaced abbreviation means the piece is not in either book. Most of these are included in appendices here, while the rest are sufficiently common and within the public domain so as to be easily found online (e.g., “O Holy Night.”) Hymn tunes (indicated by ALL CAPS) or composer names (Title Case) are provided where necessary to distinguish between multiple songs with the same name or one song put to multiple melodies.\nThe Gather hard-bound hymnals by GIA Publications, Inc. were generously donated to the parish with the intention of being used long-term. Out of appreciation for the families that contributed and those for whom the books were donated, they should be used as amply as possible. Several choral editions are available for the choir. These should be kept track of and used only by designated music ministers. All books should be treated with care to ensure their longevity. Be careful turning pages; avoid stuffing bulletins or paper into the book, as this destroys the binding; do not bend books backwards; do not write on or mark any page in any way. Treat them as property of the parish.\nDespite its continued popularity in Catholic parishes across the United States, the Gather hymnal contains lots of songs whose theology is questionable at best from a Catholic perspective. People pray what they sing and believe what they pray. Thus, hymn lyrics should be carefully scrutinized and pastoral discernment exercised when choosing songs to use at Mass. Unfortunately, a sizeable percentage of the Gather repertoire falls short of this standard. (Is it surprising, then, that so many Catholics have such a shallow understanding of the rich Catholic faith?) Collectively, the music schedules in this book seek to utilize all of the theologically-appropriate music in Gather over the three-year cycle. Because of the limited options, most songs are used many times over. While some favorites may not appear one year, they are likely to be found in another year. This approach helps keep the music fresh, accommodates a wide variety of musical tastes and preferences, and exposes the parish to the wide spectrum of traditional and contemporary music collections of the Catholic Church.",

    "section": "Mass Settings | Parts of the Mass",
    "text": "Mass Settings | Parts of the Mass\nLiturgical Seasons have been punctuated musically by different Mass settings, which consist of the Kyrie Eleison (“Lord, have mercy”); Gloria; Holy, Holy, Holy (or Sanctus); Memorial Acclamation; Great Amen; and Lamb of God (Agnus Dei). The preamble to each season section contains the Mass setting(s) to be used throughout that season, unless otherwise noted.\nThe liturgical year starts with Advent. The selected Mass setting for this season is “Missa Emmanual”, based on the popular Advent hymn “O Come, O Come, Emmanual”. Since the tune is so familiar to all Catholics in the United States, it is an easy Mass setting to pick up; one needs only master putting the Mass texts to the familiar tune. Similarly, the Mass setting used during the short Christmas season is “A Christmas Carol Mass.”” Each Mass part is derived from a different Christmas carol, all of which are very familiar to the Catholic faithful. In addition to being easy to learn, the idea here is that people will hear and sing familiar Christmas carol tunes several times each year throughout an otherwise short Christmas season, during which there is hardly opportunity to sing each Christmas carol once.\nThe “Mass of Charity and Love” is sung during Lent. This somber setting in E minor is based upon the chant “Where Charity and Love Prevail” and is well-suited for this penitential season in the Church year. The Gloria to this setting has not been introduced to the congregation, since it is omitted during Lent, so other Mass settings are used on solemnities falling within Lent that require the Gloria. For Ordinary Time and the Easter seasons, three different Mass settings have been selected, one for each liturgical year. This is to prevent any particular setting from becoming old and “tired” from overuse while maintaining consistency throughout a given year. Their selections are deliberate:",

    "section": "Notes, Instructions, and Best Practices",
    "text": "Notes, Instructions, and Best Practices\nEach liturgy is supplemented with relevant notes and instructions wherever appropriate. Some of these are generic pointers that the music minister should be mindful of. Others articulate requests from pastors and, as such, are subject to change. Still others are liturgical instructions taken from the General Instruction of the Roman Missal (GERM, (United States Conference of Catholic Bishops 2011)) and are included here to provide guidance on particularities of certain liturgies. These are especially important during Holy Week, and it is hoped that the provided information is found to be useful. All instructions should be carefully noted and followed to ensure that the musicians are liturgically harmonized with the presider. Still, the instructions herein should never replace direct consultation with the presider: if there are any questions or doubt, it is the musician’s responsibility to confirm with the presider well before the start of Mass.1\nA couple overarching musical notes should be made before concluding this discussion. First, separate communion and meditation hymns are provided for every Mass. This helps accommodates longer communion lines when needed. The scheduled meditation hymns should always be sung during Advent, Christmas, Lent, and Easter seasons in order to emphasize the spirituality of these seasons, even if communion is finished, and unless the presider or pastor instructs otherwise. As for Ordinary Time, many of the scheduled meditation hymns connect to either the readings, Mass themes, or communion antiphons. These can be considered true meditation hymns and should be sung if possible. Some are merely second communion songs and may be omitted at the discretion of the music minister. Please look ahead to determine which of these categories the meditation hymn falls into (it will rarely, if ever, be ambiguous.) When in doubt, and unless instructed otherwise by the pastor, musicians are encouraged to sing at least part of the meditation hymn since, as the name implies, they provide an opportunity to lead the congregation into deeper reflection into the sacrament and liturgy as a whole.\nMany parishes nowadays celebrate a number of bilingual liturgies throughout the year that afford the parish opportunities to come together as a single community. In some of these cases the English and Spanish music ministries ought to also join together and share musical responsibilities, while in other cases one particular group may be asked to provide all the music but in both languages. This booklet provides English selections for these occasions and indicates space holders where Spanish pieces should be inserted. If multiple music groups come together, collaboration is necessarily and flexibility is warranted. If, for example, this booklet suggests an English processional song and Spanish offertory song but there is interest in reversing these at a certain Mass, the music minister should not merely move the English selection to offertory (for the reasons stated above) but rather should select a new appropriate song using the heuristic provided in the section Hymn Selection: A Heuristic above.\nSpecial consideration should be given to the Church’s preference for organ music, particulary for processional and recessional hymns when planning music for bilingual liturgies, as much of the commonly-used Spanish music is generally not be well-suited for organ. As a matter of practice, the responsorial psalm is generally sung in the same language as the First Reading, and Gospel acclamation sung in the same language as the Second Reading. The same applies to the parts of the Mass: each Mass part (Holy, Holy, Holy; Memorial Acclamation; Great Amen; and Lamb of God) should be sung in the language that immediately precedes it, regardless of what is specified in this booklet. Music ministers are strongly encouraged to consult the presider ahead of time to minimize surprises in this regard, but both English and Spanish music ministries should be prepared with their own psalm, Gospel acclamation, and full Mass setting. It is always better to be over-prepared and flexible than caught off-guard and surprised. Additional notes on bilingual liturgies are provided in the “Notes” section of the music schedule as needed.\nFinally, it should be pointed out that nearly every hymn, song, and Mass setting are linked to YouTube recordings to assist with learning or becoming familiar with the pieces. The recordings were selected according to their musical quality in terms of how the song was performed, the instrument(s) used, the quality of singing, etc. The lyrics in the videos do not necessarily mirror those found in the parish hymnals. Cantors and choir members should always sing from the hymnals, not the lyrics found online. As of the release of this booklet, all but three songs—equating to 99.2%—have working video links. Simply click the name of any song in the PDF booklet. Of course, there is no guarantee these links will all work indefinitely. Searching the song title, composer name, and/or hymn tune should return plenty of alternative videos in the event a broken link is discovered in the future.\n\n\n\n\nUnited States Conference of Catholic Bishops. 2011.

Be respectful of the fact that the priest will be prayerfully preparing himself for the Mass in the minutes before the service starts, so make every effort to consult him at least ten or fifteen minutes beforehand.↩︎",

    "text": "The Missa Emmanuel by Richard Proulx puts the texts of the Mass to the fifteenth-century chant tune “Bone Jesu dulcis cunctis,” more commonly known as “Veni, Veni, Emmanuel” (“O Come, O Come, Emmanuel.”) The tune’s familiarity makes this Mass setting easy to learn and sing. It is preferred for all Masses during Advent for all years (A, B, C) unless otherwise noted in the Notes for a specific liturgy or occasion. Alternatively, the Mass of Angels and Saints, which includes an Advent Penitential Rite, can be used instead, particularly for the Kyrie and Lamb of God:\n\n\n  Years A, B, C\n\n2024 \\(\\bullet\\) 2025 \\(\\bullet\\) 2026 \\(\\bullet\\) 2027 \\(\\bullet\\) 2028…2046 \\(\\bullet\\) 2047 \\(\\bullet\\) 2048 \\(\\bullet\\) 2049 \\(\\bullet\\) 2050\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyrie\nGIA\nMissa Emmanuel\n\n\n\nGIA\nMass of Angels and Saints: Advent Kyrie\n\n\nGloria\n\nOmitted during Advent\n\n\nHoly, Holy, Holy\nGIA\nMissa Emmanual\n\n\nMemorial Acclamation\nGIA\nYear A: Missa Emmanuel, A (\"When we eat...\")\n\n\n\nGIA\nYear B: Missa Emmanuel, B (\"We proclaim your death...\")\n\n\n\nGIA\nYear C: Missa Emmanuel, C (\"Save us, Savior...\")\n\n\nAmen\nGIA\nMissa Emmanuel\n\n\nLamb of God\nGIA\nMissa Emmanuel\n\n\n\nGIA\nMass of Angels and Saints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdeally, the presider should sing the Kyrie invocations, if capable.

Cantors, singers, and instrumentalists should all follow along with the Order of the Liturgy found in the missalette section of Breaking Bread. The Liturgy of the Eucharist, starting with the Oﬀertory hymn, proceeds as usual.\nThe Easter Vigil continues, culminates, and concludes the single liturgy of the Holy Triduum. Thus, it begins in silence. No prelude music is permitted, and no music rehearsals of any kind, including singer warm-ups, should take place in the church before the service. The organ and other musical instruments should be used only so as to support singing until the Gloria.\nThe cantor leads the congregation in all chanted responses throughout the Liturgy, starting with the “Thanks be to God” triplicate as the Holy Cross is brought into the church.\nThe cantor may be asked by the presider to chant the Paschal Proclamation (also known as the Exsultet). He/she should be extremely comfortable with this important – and lengthy – chant, which is to be done a capella and in the dark. Be sure to confirm with the presider whether to chant the long version (provided in Appendix E, usually preferred) or the optional shorter version. Always omit the section for Deacon/Priest only (see instructions in Appendix E), regardless of the version used.\nThe presider may opt to shorten the Liturgy of the Word by omitting the second, fourth, and sixth sets of readings, psalms, and prayers. Music ministers should be sure to consult with the presider well before the Mass to know how this will be done.\nThe Celebrant intones the Gloria with “Glory to God in the highest” or “Gloria in excelsis Deo.” The introduction can be started immediately after this and the Gloria is sung as usual while bells are rung. The organist is encouraged to use the Zimbelstern throughout the entire piece. Cantors and singers should be prepared to sing strongly and joyously.\nIf Baptism is not celebrated, the Litany of the Saints and the “Water of Life” acclamations are omitted.\nThe Regina Cæli may be chanted (with light accompaniment) after Communion during the Easter Season if requested by the presider or if custom to the parish. It is not prescribed in the Liturgy.\nIf the dismissal of the people is chanted by the presider, the cantor and/or choir must promptly – without pause or hesitation – lead the chanted response, as found in Appendix F.\nThe hymn, “Hail Thee, Festival Day”, could be considered as a Recessional hymn if (1) it is available in the hymnal, (2) a strong choir and skilled musicians are performing at the Easter Vigil, AND (3) the congregation is not likely to sing at this Liturgy. It is usually unfamiliar to Catholic congregations and is diﬃcult to sing; thus, it needs to be well rehearsed by choir, cantor, and musicians alike in order to be performed accurately and well. Nevertheless, it is a particularly festive hymn that is highly appropriate for this occasion. If used, only the Easter verses (1-2) should be sung this night.",

These are to be selected by the presider. The music minister should be sure to consult with the presider before the liturgy to know what psalm to sing.\nThe presider may opt to use the same readings as Pentecost Sunday. In this case, the music selections are taken from Pentecost Sunday, not from this list. The music minister must coordinate this with the presider before the start of the liturgy.\nIf celebrated, the Vigil of Pentecost liturgy begins in the usual way with the Processional hymn and Kyrie; however, the Gloria is not sung until after the readings, as at the Easter Vigil.\nThe Liturgy of the Word is organized just like at the Easter Vigil, with a series of readings, responsorial psalms, and prayers.\nAfter the prayer following the last reading and responsorial psalm, the Celebrant intones the Gloria with “Glory to God in the highest” or “Gloria in excelsis Deo.” The introduction can be started immediately after this and the Gloria is sung as usual while the altar candles are lit.\nIf available, the Festival Alleluia (GIA), with the Pentecost verse found in Appendix B, is sung for the Gospel Acclamation.\nIf the dismissal of the people is chanted by the presider, the cantor must promptly – without pause or hesitation – lead the chanted response found in Appendix F.\nThe hymn, “Hail Thee, Festival Day”, could be considered as a Recessional hymn if (1) it is available in the hymnal, (2) a strong choir and skilled musicians are performing at the Vigil of Pentecost, AND (3) the congregation is not likely to sing at this Liturgy. It is usually unfamiliar to Catholic congregations and is diﬃcult to sing; thus, it needs to be well rehearsed by choir, cantor, and musicians alike in order to be performed accurately and well. Nevertheless, it is a particularly festive hymn that is highly appropriate for this occasion. If used, the Pentecost verses (5-6) should be sung this night.",
