# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book is the product of more than two decades of serving in music ministries in various capacities throughout several states. It contains liturgical music selections for all Catholic solemnities throughout the year as well as some feasts. "Solemnities" include all Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation. Selections are provided for the two major Catholic music publishers in the United States: [Oregon Catholic Press (OCP)](https://ocp.org/en-us) and [GIA Publications, Inc.](https://giamusic.com/about-sm) Fundamentally, it seeks to capture the best of the best music ministries I encountered over the years.
