### Notes
:::

* The **Easter Vigil** requires extra vigilance and attention to detail by all ministers, including and especially the music ministry. Cantors, singers, and instrumentalists should all follow along with the Order of the
Liturgy found in the missalette section of Breaking Bread. The Liturgy of
the Eucharist, starting with the **Oﬀertory hymn**, proceeds as usual.
* The **Easter Vigil** continues, culminates, and concludes the single liturgy of the Holy Triduum. Thus, it begins in silence. No prelude music is permitted, and no music rehearsals of any kind, including singer
warm-ups, should take place in the church before the service. The organ
and other musical instruments should be used only so as to support
singing until the **Gloria**.
* The cantor leads the congregation in all chanted responses throughout
the Liturgy, starting with the **“Thanks be to God”** triplicate as the
Holy Cross is brought into the church.
* The cantor may be asked by the presider to chant the **Paschal
Proclamation** (also known as the *Exsultet*). He/she should be
extremely comfortable with this important – and lengthy – chant, which
is to be done *a capella* and in the dark. Be sure to confirm with the
presider whether to chant the long version (provided in Appendix E: The
Paschal Proclamation, usually preferred) or the optional shorter version.
Always omit the section for Deacon/Priest only (see instructions in
Appendix E: The Paschal Proclamation), regardless of the version used.
* The presider may opt to shorten the Liturgy of the Word by omitting the
second, fourth, and sixth sets of readings, psalms, and prayers. Music
ministers should be sure to consult with the presider well before the Mass
to know how this will be done.
* The Celebrant intones the **Gloria** with “*Glory to God in the highest*” or “*Gloria in excelsis Deo.*” The introduction can be started immediately after this and the **Gloria** is sung as usual while bells are rung. The organist is encouraged to use the Zimbelstern throughout the entire piece. Cantors and singers should be prepared to sing strongly and joyously.
* *If Baptism is not celebrated, the **Litany of the Saints** and the
**“Water of Life”** acclamations are omitted.
* The **Regina Cæli** *may* be chanted (with light accompaniment) after
Communion during the Easter Season if requested by the presider or if
custom to the parish. It is not prescribed in the Liturgy.
* If the **dismissal of the people** is chanted by the presider, the cantor
and/or choir must promptly – without pause or hesitation – lead the
chanted response, as found in Appendix F: Easter Dismissal.
* The hymn, “Hail Thee, Festival Day”, could be considered as a **Recessional hymn** if (1) it is available in the hymnal, (2) a strong choir and skilled musicians are performing at the **Easter Vigil**, AND (3) the congregation is not likely to sing at this Liturgy. It is usually unfamiliar to Catholic congregations and is diﬃcult to sing; thus, it needs to be well rehearsed by choir, cantor, and musicians alike in order to be performed accurately and well. Nevertheless, it is a particularly festive hymn that is highly appropriate for this occasion. If used, only the Easter verses (1-2) should be sung this night.
