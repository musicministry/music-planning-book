<p>When Jesus and the disciples drew near Jerusalem<br>
and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives,<br>
Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them,<br>
“Go into the village opposite you,<br>
and immediately you will find an ass tethered,<br>
and a colt with her.<br>
Untie them and bring them here to me.<br>
And if anyone should say anything to you, reply,<br>
‘The master has need of them.’<br>
Then he will send them at once.”<br>
This happened so that what had been spoken through the prophet<br>
might be fulfilled:<br>
<em>Say to daughter Zion,</em><br>
“<em>Behold, your king comes to you,</em><br>
<em>meek and riding on an ass,</em><br>
<em>and on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.</em>”<br>
The disciples went and did as Jesus had ordered them.<br>
They brought the ass and the colt and laid their cloaks over them,<br>
and he sat upon them.<br>
The very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road,<br>
while others cut branches from the trees<br>
and strewed them on the road.<br>
The crowds preceding him and those following<br>
kept crying out and saying:<br>
“Hosanna to the Son of David;<br>
blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord;<br>
hosanna in the highest.”<br>
And when he entered Jerusalem<br>
the whole city was shaken and asked, “Who is this?”<br>
And the crowds replied,<br>
“This is Jesus the prophet, from Nazareth in Galilee.”</p>

</section>
<p>One of the Twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot,<br>
went to the chief priests and said,<br>
“What are you willing to give me<br>
if I hand him over to you?”<br>
They paid him thirty pieces of silver,<br>
and from that time on he looked for an opportunity<br>
to hand him over.</p>
<p>On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread,<br>
the disciples approached Jesus and said,<br>
“Where do you want us to prepare<br>
for you to eat the Passover?”<br>
He said,<br>
“Go into the city to a certain man and tell him,<br>
‘The teacher says, “My appointed time draws near;<br>
in your house I shall celebrate the Passover with my disciples.”’”<br>
The disciples then did as Jesus had ordered,<br>
and prepared the Passover.</p>
<p>When it was evening,<br>
he reclined at table with the Twelve.<br>
And while they were eating, he said,<br>
“Amen, I say to you, one of you will betray me.”<br>
Deeply distressed at this,<br>
they began to say to him one after another,<br>
“Surely it is not I, Lord?”<br>
He said in reply,<br>
“He who has dipped his hand into the dish with me<br>
is the one who will betray me.<br>
The Son of Man indeed goes, as it is written of him,<br>
but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed.<br>
It would be better for that man if he had never been born.”<br>
Then Judas, his betrayer, said in reply,<br>
“Surely it is not I, Rabbi?”<br>
He answered, “You have said so.”</p>
<p>While they were eating,<br>
Jesus took bread, said the blessing,<br>
broke it, and giving it to his disciples said,<br>
“Take and eat; this is my body.”<br>
Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying,<br>
“Drink from it, all of you,<br>
for this is my blood of the covenant,<br>
which will be shed on behalf of many<br>
for the forgiveness of sins.<br>
I tell you, from now on I shall not drink this fruit of the vine<br>
until the day when I drink it with you new<br>
in the kingdom of my Father.”<br>
Then, after singing a hymn,<br>
they went out to the Mount of Olives.</p>
<p>Then Jesus said to them,<br>
“This night all of you will have your faith in me shaken,<br>
for it is written:<br>
<em>I will strike the shepherd,</em><br>
<em>and the sheep of the flock will be dispersed</em>;<br>
but after I have been raised up,<br>
I shall go before you to Galilee.”<br>
Peter said to him in reply,<br>
“Though all may have their faith in you shaken,<br>
mine will never be.”<br>
Jesus said to him,<br>
“Amen, I say to you,<br>
this very night before the cock crows,<br>
you will deny me three times.”<br>
Peter said to him,<br>
“Even though I should have to die with you,<br>
I will not deny you.”<br>
And all the disciples spoke likewise.</p>
<p>Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane,<br>
and he said to his disciples,<br>
“Sit here while I go over there and pray.”<br>
He took along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee,<br>
and began to feel sorrow and distress.<br>
Then he said to them,<br>
“My soul is sorrowful even to death.<br>
Remain here and keep watch with me.”<br>
He advanced a little and fell prostrate in prayer, saying,<br>
“My Father, if it is possible,<br>
let this cup pass from me;<br>
yet, not as I will, but as you will.”<br>
When he returned to his disciples he found them asleep.<br>
He said to Peter,<br>
“So you could not keep watch with me for one hour?<br>
Watch and pray that you may not undergo the test.<br>
The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”<br>
Withdrawing a second time, he prayed again,<br>
“My Father, if it is not possible that this cup pass<br>
without my drinking it, your will be done!”<br>
Then he returned once more and found them asleep,<br>
for they could not keep their eyes open.<br>
He left them and withdrew again and prayed a third time,<br>
saying the same thing again.<br>
Then he returned to his disciples and said to them,<br>
“Are you still sleeping and taking your rest?<br>
Behold, the hour is at hand<br>
when the Son of Man is to be handed over to sinners.<br>
Get up, let us go.<br>
Look, my betrayer is at hand.”</p>
<p>While he was still speaking,<br>
Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived,<br>
accompanied by a large crowd, with swords and clubs,<br>
who had come from the chief priests and the elders<br>
of the people.<br>
His betrayer had arranged a sign with them, saying,<br>
“The man I shall kiss is the one; arrest him.”<br>
Immediately he went over to Jesus and said,<br>
“Hail, Rabbi!” and he kissed him.<br>
Jesus answered him,<br>
“Friend, do what you have come for.”<br>
Then stepping forward they laid hands on Jesus and arrested him.<br>
And behold, one of those who accompanied Jesus<br>
put his hand to his sword, drew it,<br>
and struck the high priest’s servant, cutting off his ear.<br>
Then Jesus said to him,<br>
“Put your sword back into its sheath,<br>
for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.<br>
Do you think that I cannot call upon my Father<br>
and he will not provide me at this moment<br>
with more than twelve legions of angels?<br>
But then how would the Scriptures be fulfilled<br>
which say that it must come to pass in this way?”<br>
At that hour Jesus said to the crowds,<br>
“Have you come out as against a robber,<br>
with swords and clubs to seize me?<br>
Day after day I sat teaching in the temple area,<br>
yet you did not arrest me.<br>
But all this has come to pass<br>
that the writings of the prophets may be fulfilled.”<br>
Then all the disciples left him and fled.</p>
<p>Those who had arrested Jesus led him away<br>
to Caiaphas the high priest,<br>
where the scribes and the elders were assembled.<br>
Peter was following him at a distance<br>
as far as the high priest’s courtyard,<br>
and going inside he sat down with the servants<br>
to see the outcome.<br>
The chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin<br>
kept trying to obtain false testimony against Jesus<br>
in order to put him to death,<br>
but they found none,<br>
though many false witnesses came forward.<br>
Finally two came forward who stated,<br>
“This man said, ‘I can destroy the temple of God<br>
and within three days rebuild it.’”<br>
The high priest rose and addressed him,<br>
“Have you no answer?<br>
What are these men testifying against you?”<br>
But Jesus was silent.<br>
Then the high priest said to him,<br>
“I order you to tell us under oath before the living God<br>
whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.”<br>
Jesus said to him in reply,<br>
“You have said so.<br>
But I tell you:<br>
From now on you will see ‘the Son of Man<br>
seated at the right hand of the Power’<br>
and ‘coming on the clouds of heaven.’”<br>
Then the high priest tore his robes and said,<br>
“He has blasphemed!<br>
What further need have we of witnesses?<br>
You have now heard the blasphemy;<br>
what is your opinion?”<br>
They said in reply,<br>
“He deserves to die!”<br>
Then they spat in his face and struck him,<br>
while some slapped him, saying,<br>
“Prophesy for us, Christ: who is it that struck you?”</p>
<p>Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard.<br>
One of the maids came over to him and said,<br>
“You too were with Jesus the Galilean.”<br>
But he denied it in front of everyone, saying,<br>
“I do not know what you are talking about!”<br>
As he went out to the gate, another girl saw him<br>
and said to those who were there,<br>
“This man was with Jesus the Nazorean.”<br>
Again he denied it with an oath,<br>
“I do not know the man!”<br>
A little later the bystanders came over and said to Peter,<br>
“Surely you too are one of them;<br>
even your speech gives you away.”<br>
At that he began to curse and to swear,<br>
“I do not know the man.”<br>
And immediately a cock crowed.<br>
Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken:<br>
“Before the cock crows you will deny me three times.”<br>
He went out and began to weep bitterly.</p>
<p>When it was morning,<br>
all the chief priests and the elders of the people. took counsel against Jesus to put him to death.<br>
They bound him, led him away,<br>
and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.</p>
<p>Then Judas, his betrayer, seeing that Jesus had been condemned,<br>
deeply regretted what he had done.<br>
He returned the thirty pieces of silver. to the chief priests and elders, saying,<br>
“I have sinned in betraying innocent blood.”<br>
They said,<br>
“What is that to us?<br>
Look to it yourself.”<br>
Flinging the money into the temple,<br>
he departed and went off and hanged himself.<br>
The chief priests gathered up the money, but said,<br>
“It is not lawful to deposit this in the temple treasury,<br>
for it is the price of blood.”<br>
After consultation, they used it to buy the potter’s field<br>
as a burial place for foreigners.<br>
That is why that field even today is called the Field of Blood.<br>
Then was fulfilled what had been said through Jeremiah<br>
the prophet,<br>
<em>And they took the thirty pieces of silver,</em><br>
<em>the value of a man with a price on his head,</em><br>
<em>a price set by some of the Israelites,</em><br>
<em>and they paid it out for the potter’s field</em><br>
<em>just as the Lord had commanded me.</em></p>
<p>Now Jesus stood before the governor, and he questioned him,<br>
“Are you the king of the Jews?”<br>
Jesus said, “You say so.”<br>
And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders,<br>
he made no answer.<br>
Then Pilate said to him,<br>
“Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?”<br>
But he did not answer him one word,<br>
so that the governor was greatly amazed.</p>
<p>Now on the occasion of the feast<br>
the governor was accustomed to release to the crowd<br>
one prisoner whom they wished.<br>
And at that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.<br>
So when they had assembled, Pilate said to them,<br>
“Which one do you want me to release to you,<br>
Barabbas, or Jesus called Christ?”<br>
For he knew that it was out of envy<br>
that they had handed him over.<br>
While he was still seated on the bench,<br>
his wife sent him a message,<br>
“Have nothing to do with that righteous man.<br>
I suffered much in a dream today because of him.”<br>
The chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds<br>
to ask for Barabbas but to destroy Jesus.<br>
The governor said to them in reply,<br>
“Which of the two do you want me to release to you?”<br>
They answered, “Barabbas!”<br>
Pilate said to them,<br>
“Then what shall I do with Jesus called Christ?”<br>
They all said,<br>
“Let him be crucified!”<br>
But he said,<br>
“Why? What evil has he done?”<br>
They only shouted the louder,<br>
“Let him be crucified!”<br>
When Pilate saw that he was not succeeding at all,<br>
but that a riot was breaking out instead,<br>
he took water and washed his hands in the sight of the crowd,<br>
saying, “I am innocent of this man’s blood.<br>
Look to it yourselves.”<br>
And the whole people said in reply,<br>
“His blood be upon us and upon our children.”<br>
Then he released Barabbas to them,<br>
but after he had Jesus scourged,<br>
he handed him over to be crucified.</p>
<p>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus inside the praetorium<br>
and gathered the whole cohort around him.<br>
They stripped off his clothes<br>
and threw a scarlet military cloak about him.<br>
Weaving a crown out of thorns, they placed it on his head,<br>
and a reed in his right hand.<br>
And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying,<br>
“Hail, King of the Jews!”<br>
They spat upon him and took the reed<br>
and kept striking him on the head.<br>
And when they had mocked him,<br>
they stripped him of the cloak,<br>
dressed him in his own clothes,<br>
and led him off to crucify him.</p>
<p>As they were going out, they met a Cyrenian named Simon;<br>
this man they pressed into service<br>
to carry his cross.</p>
<p>And when they came to a place called Golgotha<br>
—which means Place of the Skull —,<br>
they gave Jesus wine to drink mixed with gall.<br>
But when he had tasted it, he refused to drink.<br>
After they had crucified him,<br>
they divided his garments by casting lots;<br>
then they sat down and kept watch over him there.<br>
And they placed over his head the written charge against him:<br>
This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.<br>
Two revolutionaries were crucified with him,<br>
one on his right and the other on his left.<br>
Those passing by reviled him, shaking their heads and saying,<br>
“You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,<br>
save yourself, if you are the Son of God,<br>
and come down from the cross!”<br>
Likewise the chief priests with the scribes and elders mocked him and said,<br>
“He saved others; he cannot save himself.<br>
So he is the king of Israel!<br>
Let him come down from the cross now,<br>
and we will believe in him.<br>
He trusted in God;<br>
let him deliver him now if he wants him.<br>
For he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”<br>
The revolutionaries who were crucified with him<br>
also kept abusing him in the same way.</p>
<p>From noon onward, darkness came over the whole land<br>
until three in the afternoon.<br>
And about three o’clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice,<br>
<em>“Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?”</em><br>
which means, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”<br>
Some of the bystanders who heard it said,<br>
“This one is calling for Elijah.”<br>
Immediately one of them ran to get a sponge;<br>
he soaked it in wine, and putting it on a reed,<br>
gave it to him to drink.<br>
But the rest said,<br>
“Wait, let us see if Elijah comes to save him.”<br>
But Jesus cried out again in a loud voice,<br>
and gave up his spirit.</p>
<p><span class="red"><em>Here all kneel and pause for a short time.</em></span></p>
<p>And behold, the veil of the sanctuary<br>
was torn in two from top to bottom.<br>
The earth quaked, rocks were split, tombs were opened,<br>
and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised.<br>
And coming forth from their tombs after his resurrection,<br>
they entered the holy city and appeared to many.<br>
The centurion and the men with him who were keeping watch over Jesus<br>
feared greatly when they saw the earthquake<br>
and all that was happening, and they said,<br>
“Truly, this was the Son of God!”<br>
There were many women there, looking on from a distance,<br>
who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him.<br>
Among them were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph,<br>
and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</p>
<p>When it was evening,<br>
there came a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph,<br>
who was himself a disciple of Jesus.<br>
He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus;<br>
then Pilate ordered it to be handed over.<br>
Taking the body, Joseph wrapped it in clean linen<br>
and laid it in his new tomb that he had hewn in the rock.<br>
Then he rolled a huge stone across the entrance to the tomb and departed.<br>
But Mary Magdalene and the other Mary<br>
remained sitting there, facing the tomb.</p>
<p>The next day, the one following the day of preparation,<br>
the chief priests and the Pharisees<br>
gathered before Pilate and said,<br>
“Sir, we remember that this impostor while still alive said,<br>
‘After three days I will be raised up.’<br>
Give orders, then, that the grave be secured until the third day,<br>
lest his disciples come and steal him and say to the people,<br>
‘He has been raised from the dead.’<br>
This last imposture would be worse than the first.”<br>
Pilate said to them,<br>
“The guard is yours;<br>
go, secure it as best you can.”<br>
So they went and secured the tomb<br>
by fixing a seal to the stone and setting the guard.</p>
<p><span class="red">Or:</span></p>
<p>Jesus stood before the governor, Pontius Pilate, who questioned him,<br>
“Are you the king of the Jews?”<br>
Jesus said, “You say so.”<br>
And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders,<br>
he made no answer.<br>
Then Pilate said to him,<br>

<p>When Jesus and his disciples drew near to Jerusalem,<br>
to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives,<br>
he sent two of his disciples and said to them,<br>
“Go into the village opposite you,<br>
and immediately on entering it,<br>
you will find a colt tethered on which no one has ever sat.<br>
Untie it and bring it here.<br>
If anyone should say to you,<br>
‘Why are you doing this?’ reply,<br>
‘The Master has need of it<br>
and will send it back here at once.’”<br>
So they went off<br>
and found a colt tethered at a gate outside on the street,<br>
and they untied it.<br>
Some of the bystanders said to them,<br>
“What are you doing, untying the colt?”<br>
They answered them just as Jesus had told them to,<br>
and they permitted them to do it.<br>
So they brought the colt to Jesus<br>
and put their cloaks over it.<br>
And he sat on it.<br>
Many people spread their cloaks on the road,<br>
and others spread leafy branches<br>
that they had cut from the fields.<br>
Those preceding him as well as those following kept crying out:<br>
  “Hosanna!<br>
    Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!<br>
    Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is to come!<br>
  Hosanna in the highest!”</p>
<p><span class="red">Or:</span> <span class="small red" style="float:right">John 12:12-16</span></p>
<p>When the great crowd that had come to the feast heard<br>
that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,<br>
they took palm branches and went out to meet him, and cried out:<br>
  “Hosanna!<br>
  “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,<br>
    the king of Israel.”<br>
Jesus found an ass and sat upon it, as is written:<br>
  Fear no more, O daughter Zion;<br>
  see, your king comes, seated upon an ass’s colt.<br>
His disciples did not understand this at first,<br>
but when Jesus had been glorified<br>
they remembered that these things were written about him<br>
and that they had done this for him.</p>

<p>The Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread<br>
were to take place in two days’ time.<br>
So the chief priests and the scribes were seeking a way<br>
to arrest him by treachery and put him to death.<br>
They said, “Not during the festival,<br>
for fear that there may be a riot among the people.”</p>
<p>When he was in Bethany reclining at table<br>
in the house of Simon the leper,<br>
a woman came with an alabaster jar of perfumed oil,<br>
costly genuine spikenard.<br>
She broke the alabaster jar and poured it on his head.<br>
There were some who were indignant.<br>
“Why has there been this waste of perfumed oil?<br>
It could have been sold for more than three hundred days’ wages<br>
and the money given to the poor.”<br>
They were infuriated with her.<br>
Jesus said, “Let her alone.<br>
Why do you make trouble for her?<br>
She has done a good thing for me.<br>
The poor you will always have with you,<br>
and whenever you wish you can do good to them,<br>
but you will not always have me.<br>
She has done what she could.<br>
She has anticipated anointing my body for burial.<br>
Amen, I say to you,<br>
wherever the gospel is proclaimed to the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her.”</p>
<p>Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve,<br>
went off to the chief priests to hand him over to them.<br>
When they heard him they were pleased and promised to pay him money.<br>
Then he looked for an opportunity to hand him over.</p>
<p>On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread,<br>
when they sacrificed the Passover lamb,<br>
his disciples said to him,<br>
“Where do you want us to go<br>
and prepare for you to eat the Passover?”<br>
He sent two of his disciples and said to them,<br>
“Go into the city and a man will meet you,<br>
carrying a jar of water.<br>
Follow him.<br>
Wherever he enters, say to the master of the house,<br>
‘The Teacher says, “Where is my guest room<br>
where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’<br>
Then he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready.<br>
Make the preparations for us there.”<br>
The disciples then went off, entered the city,<br>
and found it just as he had told them;<br>
and they prepared the Passover.</p>
<p>When it was evening, he came with the Twelve.<br>
And as they reclined at table and were eating, Jesus said,<br>
“Amen, I say to you, one of you will betray me,<br>
one who is eating with me.”<br>
They began to be distressed and to say to him, one by one,<br>
“Surely it is not I?”<br>
He said to them,<br>
“One of the Twelve, the one who dips with me into the dish.<br>
For the Son of Man indeed goes, as it is written of him,<br>
but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed.<br>
It would be better for that man if he had never been born.”</p>
<p>While they were eating,<br>
he took bread, said the blessing,<br>
broke it, and gave it to them, and said,<br>
“Take it; this is my body.”<br>
Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them,<br>
and they all drank from it.<br>
He said to them,<br>
“This is my blood of the covenant,<br>
which will be shed for many.<br>
Amen, I say to you,<br>
I shall not drink again the fruit of the vine<br>
until the day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”<br>
Then, after singing a hymn,<br>
they went out to the Mount of Olives.</p>
<p>Then Jesus said to them,<br>
“All of you will have your faith shaken, for it is written:<br>
  <em>I will strike the shepherd,</em><br>
    <em>and the sheep will be dispersed.</em><br>
But after I have been raised up,<br>
I shall go before you to Galilee.”<br>
Peter said to him,<br>
“Even though all should have their faith shaken,<br>
mine will not be.”<br>
Then Jesus said to him,<br>
“Amen, I say to you,<br>
this very night before the cock crows twice<br>
you will deny me three times.”<br>
But he vehemently replied,<br>
“Even though I should have to die with you,<br>
I will not deny you.”<br>
And they all spoke similarly.</p>
<p>Then they came to a place named Gethsemane,<br>
and he said to his disciples,<br>
“Sit here while I pray.”<br>
He took with him Peter, James, and John,<br>
and began to be troubled and distressed.<br>
Then he said to them, “My soul is sorrowful even to death.<br>
Remain here and keep watch.”<br>
He advanced a little and fell to the ground and prayed<br>
that if it were possible the hour might pass by him;<br>
he said, “Abba, Father, all things are possible to you.<br>
Take this cup away from me,<br>
but not what I will but what you will.”<br>
When he returned he found them asleep.<br>
He said to Peter, “Simon, are you asleep?<br>
Could you not keep watch for one hour?<br>
Watch and pray that you may not undergo the test.<br>
The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.”<br>
Withdrawing again, he prayed, saying the same thing.<br>
Then he returned once more and found them asleep,<br>
for they could not keep their eyes open<br>
and did not know what to answer him.<br>
He returned a third time and said to them,<br>
“Are you still sleeping and taking your rest?<br>
It is enough. The hour has come.<br>
Behold, the Son of Man is to be handed over to sinners.<br>
Get up, let us go.<br>
See, my betrayer is at hand.”</p>
<p>Then, while he was still speaking,<br>
Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived,<br>
accompanied by a crowd with swords and clubs<br>
who had come from the chief priests,<br>
the scribes, and the elders.<br>
His betrayer had arranged a signal with them, saying,<br>
“The man I shall kiss is the one;<br>
arrest him and lead him away securely.”<br>
He came and immediately went over to him and said,<br>
“Rabbi.” And he kissed him.<br>
At this they laid hands on him and arrested him.<br>
One of the bystanders drew his sword,<br>
struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his ear.<br>
Jesus said to them in reply,<br>
“Have you come out as against a robber,<br>
with swords and clubs, to seize me?<br>
Day after day I was with you teaching in the temple area,<br>
yet you did not arrest me;<br>
but that the Scriptures may be fulfilled.”<br>
And they all left him and fled.<br>
Now a young man followed him<br>
wearing nothing but a linen cloth about his body.<br>
They seized him,<br>
but he left the cloth behind and ran off naked.</p>
<p>They led Jesus away to the high priest,<br>
and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together.<br>
Peter followed him at a distance into the high priest’s courtyard<br>
and was seated with the guards, warming himself at the fire.<br>
The chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin<br>
kept trying to obtain testimony against Jesus<br>
in order to put him to death, but they found none.<br>
Many gave false witness against him,<br>
but their testimony did not agree.<br>
Some took the stand and testified falsely against him,<br>
alleging, “We heard him say,<br>
‘I will destroy this temple made with hands<br>
and within three days I will build another<br>
not made with hands.’”<br>
Even so their testimony did not agree.<br>
The high priest rose before the assembly and questioned Jesus,<br>
saying, “Have you no answer?<br>
What are these men testifying against you?”<br>
But he was silent and answered nothing.<br>
Again the high priest asked him and said to him,<br>
“Are you the Christ, the son of the Blessed One?”<br>
Then Jesus answered, “I am;<br>
and ‘you will see the Son of Man<br>
seated at the right hand of the Power<br>
and coming with the clouds of heaven.’”<br>
At that the high priest tore his garments and said,<br>
“What further need have we of witnesses?<br>
You have heard the blasphemy.<br>
What do you think?”<br>
They all condemned him as deserving to die.<br>
Some began to spit on him.<br>
They blindfolded him and struck him and said to him, “Prophesy!”<br>
And the guards greeted him with blows.</p>
<p>While Peter was below in the courtyard,<br>
one of the high priest’s maids came along.<br>
Seeing Peter warming himself,<br>
she looked intently at him and said,<br>
“You too were with the Nazarene, Jesus.”<br>
But he denied it saying,<br>
“I neither know nor understand what you are talking about.”<br>
So he went out into the outer court.<br>
Then the cock crowed.<br>
The maid saw him and began again to say to the bystanders,<br>
“This man is one of them.”<br>
Once again he denied it.<br>
A little later the bystanders said to Peter once more,<br>
“Surely you are one of them; for you too are a Galilean.”<br>
He began to curse and to swear,<br>
“I do not know this man about whom you are talking.”<br>
And immediately a cock crowed a second time.<br>
Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said to him,<br>
“Before the cock crows twice you will deny me three times.”<br>
He broke down and wept.</p>
<p>As soon as morning came,<br>
the chief priests with the elders and the scribes,<br>
that is, the whole Sanhedrin held a council.<br>
They bound Jesus, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate.<br>
Pilate questioned him,<br>
“Are you the king of the Jews?”<br>
He said to him in reply, “You say so.”<br>
The chief priests accused him of many things.<br>
Again Pilate questioned him,<br>
“Have you no answer?<br>
See how many things they accuse you of.”<br>
Jesus gave him no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed.</p>
<p>Now on the occasion of the feast he used to release to them<br>
one prisoner whom they requested.<br>
A man called Barabbas was then in prison<br>
along with the rebels who had committed murder in a rebellion.<br>
The crowd came forward and began to ask him<br>
to do for them as he was accustomed.<br>
Pilate answered,<br>
“Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?”<br>
For he knew that it was out of envy<br>
that the chief priests had handed him over.<br>
But the chief priests stirred up the crowd<br>
to have him release Barabbas for them instead.<br>
Pilate again said to them in reply,<br>
“Then what do you want me to do<br>
with the man you call the king of the Jews?”<br>
They shouted again, “Crucify him.”<br>
Pilate said to them, “Why? What evil has he done?”<br>
They only shouted the louder, “Crucify him.”<br>
So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd,<br>
released Barabbas to them and, after he had Jesus scourged,<br>
handed him over to be crucified.</p>
<p>The soldiers led him away inside the palace,<br>
that is, the praetorium, and assembled the whole cohort.<br>
They clothed him in purple and,<br>
weaving a crown of thorns, placed it on him.<br>
They began to salute him with, “Hail, King of the Jews!”<br>
and kept striking his head with a reed and spitting upon him.<br>
They knelt before him in homage.<br>
And when they had mocked him,<br>
they stripped him of the purple cloak,<br>
dressed him in his own clothes,<br>
and led him out to crucify him.</p>
<p>They pressed into service a passer-by, Simon,<br>
a Cyrenian, who was coming in from the country,<br>
the father of Alexander and Rufus,<br>
to carry his cross.</p>
<p>They brought him to the place of Golgotha<br>
— which is translated Place of the Skull —,<br>
They gave him wine drugged with myrrh,<br>
but he did not take it.<br>
Then they crucified him and divided his garments<br>
by casting lots for them to see what each should take.<br>
It was nine o’clock in the morning when they crucified him.<br>
The inscription of the charge against him read,<br>
“The King of the Jews.”<br>
With him they crucified two revolutionaries,<br>
one on his right and one on his left.<br>
Those passing by reviled him,<br>
shaking their heads and saying,<br>
“Aha! You who would destroy the temple<br>
and rebuild it in three days,<br>
save yourself by coming down from the cross.”<br>
Likewise the chief priests, with the scribes,<br>
mocked him among themselves and said,<br>
“He saved others; he cannot save himself.<br>
Let the Christ, the King of Israel,<br>
come down now from the cross<br>
that we may see and believe.”<br>
Those who were crucified with him also kept abusing him.</p>
<p>At noon darkness came over the whole land<br>
until three in the afternoon.<br>
And at three o’clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice,<br>
<em>“Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?”</em><br>
which is translated,<br>
“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”<br>
Some of the bystanders who heard it said,<br>
“Look, he is calling Elijah.”<br>
One of them ran, soaked a sponge with wine, put it on a reed<br>
and gave it to him to drink saying,<br>
“Wait, let us see if Elijah comes to take him down.”<br>
Jesus gave a loud cry and breathed his last.</p>
<p><span class="red"><em>Here all kneel and pause for a short time.</em></span></p>
<p>The veil of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom.<br>
When the centurion who stood facing him<br>
saw how he breathed his last he said,<br>
“Truly this man was the Son of God!”<br>
There were also women looking on from a distance.<br>
Among them were Mary Magdalene,<br>
Mary the mother of the younger James and of Joses, and Salome.<br>
These women had followed him when he was in Galilee<br>
and ministered to him.<br>
There were also many other women<br>
who had come up with him to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>When it was already evening,<br>
since it was the day of preparation,<br>
the day before the sabbath, Joseph of Arimathea,<br>
a distinguished member of the council,<br>
who was himself awaiting the kingdom of God,<br>
came and courageously went to Pilate<br>
and asked for the body of Jesus.<br>
Pilate was amazed that he was already dead.<br>
He summoned the centurion<br>
and asked him if Jesus had already died.<br>
And when he learned of it from the centurion,<br>
he gave the body to Joseph.<br>
Having bought a linen cloth, he took him down,<br>
wrapped him in the linen cloth,<br>
and laid him in a tomb that had been hewn out of the rock.<br>
Then he rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb.<br>
Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses<br>
watched where he was laid.</p>
<p><span class="red">Or:</span></p>
<p>As soon as morning came,<br>
the chief priests with the elders and the scribes,<br>
that is, the whole Sanhedrin held a council.<br>

<p>Jesus proceeded on his journey up to Jerusalem.<br>
As he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany<br>
at the place called the Mount of Olives,<br>
he sent two of his disciples.<br>
He said, “Go into the village opposite you,<br>
and as you enter it you will find a colt tethered<br>
on which no one has ever sat.<br>
Untie it and bring it here.<br>
And if anyone should ask you,<br>
‘Why are you untying it?’<br>
you will answer,<br>
‘The Master has need of it.’”<br>
So those who had been sent went off<br>
and found everything just as he had told them.<br>
And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them,<br>
“Why are you untying this colt?”<br>
They answered,<br>
“The Master has need of it.”<br>
So they brought it to Jesus,<br>
threw their cloaks over the colt,<br>
and helped Jesus to mount.<br>
As he rode along,<br>
the people were spreading their cloaks on the road;<br>
and now as he was approaching the slope of the Mount of Olives,<br>
the whole multitude of his disciples<br>
began to praise God aloud with joy<br>
for all the mighty deeds they had seen.<br>
They proclaimed:<br>
  “Blessed is the king who comes<br>
    in the name of the Lord.<br>
  Peace in heaven<br>
    and glory in the highest.”<br>
Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him,<br>
“Teacher, rebuke your disciples.”<br>
He said in reply,<br>
“I tell you, if they keep silent,<br>
the stones will cry out!”</p>

<p>The Lord GOD has given me<br>
  a well-trained tongue,<br>
that I might know how to speak to the weary<br>
  a word that will rouse them.<br>
Morning after morning<br>
  he opens my ear that I may hear;<br>
and I have not rebelled,<br>
  have not turned back.<br>
I gave my back to those who beat me,<br>
  my cheeks to those who plucked my beard;<br>
my face I did not shield<br>
  from buffets and spitting.</p>
<p>The Lord GOD is my help,<br>
  therefore I am not disgraced;<br>
I have set my face like flint,<br>
  knowing that I shall not be put to shame.</p>

<p>When the hour came,<br>
Jesus took his place at table with the apostles.<br>
He said to them,<br>
“I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,<br>
for, I tell you, I shall not eat it again<br>
until there is fulfillment in the kingdom of God.”<br>
Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and said,<br>
“Take this and share it among yourselves;<br>
for I tell you that from this time on<br>
I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine<br>
until the kingdom of God comes.”<br>
Then he took the bread, said the blessing,<br>
broke it, and gave it to them, saying,<br>
“This is my body, which will be given for you;<br>
do this in memory of me.”<br>
And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying,<br>
“This cup is the new covenant in my blood,<br>
which will be shed for you.</p>
<p>“And yet behold, the hand of the one who is to betray me<br>
is with me on the table;<br>
for the Son of Man indeed goes as it has been determined;<br>
but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed.”<br>
And they began to debate among themselves<br>
who among them would do such a deed.</p>
<p>Then an argument broke out among them<br>
about which of them should be regarded as the greatest.<br>
He said to them,<br>
“The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them<br>
and those in authority over them are addressed as ‘Benefactors’;<br>
but among you it shall not be so.<br>
Rather, let the greatest among you be as the youngest,<br>
and the leader as the servant.<br>
For who is greater:<br>
the one seated at table or the one who serves?<br>
Is it not the one seated at table?<br>
I am among you as the one who serves.<br>
It is you who have stood by me in my trials;<br>
and I confer a kingdom on you,<br>
just as my Father has conferred one on me,<br>
that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom;<br>
and you will sit on thrones<br>
judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
<p>“Simon, Simon, behold Satan has demanded<br>
to sift all of you like wheat,<br>
but I have prayed that your own faith may not fail;<br>
and once you have turned back,<br>
you must strengthen your brothers.”<br>
He said to him,<br>
“Lord, I am prepared to go to prison and to die with you.”<br>
But he replied,<br>
“I tell you, Peter, before the cock crows this day,<br>
you will deny three times that you know me.”</p>
<p>He said to them,<br>
“When I sent you forth without a money bag or a sack or sandals,<br>
were you in need of anything?”<br>
“No, nothing, “ they replied.<br>
He said to them,<br>
“But now one who has a money bag should take it,<br>
and likewise a sack,<br>
and one who does not have a sword<br>
should sell his cloak and buy one.<br>
For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me,<br>
namely, <em>He was counted among the wicked</em>;<br>
and indeed what is written about me is coming to fulfillment.”<br>
Then they said,<br>
“Lord, look, there are two swords here.”<br>
But he replied, “It is enough!”</p>
<p>Then going out, he went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives,<br>
and the disciples followed him.<br>
When he arrived at the place he said to them,<br>
“Pray that you may not undergo the test.”<br>
After withdrawing about a stone’s throw from them and kneeling,<br>
he prayed, saying, “Father, if you are willing,<br>
take this cup away from me;<br>
still, not my will but yours be done.”<br>
And to strengthen him an angel from heaven appeared to him.<br>
He was in such agony and he prayed so fervently<br>
that his sweat became like drops of blood<br>
falling on the ground.<br>
When he rose from prayer and returned to his disciples,<br>
he found them sleeping from grief.<br>
He said to them, “Why are you sleeping?<br>
Get up and pray that you may not undergo the test.”</p>
<p>While he was still speaking, a crowd approached<br>
and in front was one of the Twelve, a man named Judas.<br>
He went up to Jesus to kiss him.<br>
Jesus said to him,<br>
“Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”<br>
His disciples realized what was about to happen, and they asked,<br>
“Lord, shall we strike with a sword?”<br>
And one of them struck the high priest’s servant<br>
and cut off his right ear.<br>
But Jesus said in reply,<br>
“Stop, no more of this!”<br>
Then he touched the servant’s ear and healed him.<br>
And Jesus said to the chief priests and temple guards<br>
and elders who had come for him,<br>
“Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?<br>
Day after day I was with you in the temple area,<br>
and you did not seize me;<br>
but this is your hour, the time for the power of darkness.”</p>
<p>After arresting him they led him away<br>
and took him into the house of the high priest;<br>
Peter was following at a distance.<br>
They lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat around it,<br>
and Peter sat down with them.<br>
When a maid saw him seated in the light,<br>
she looked intently at him and said,<br>
“This man too was with him.”<br>
But he denied it saying,<br>
“Woman, I do not know him.”<br>
A short while later someone else saw him and said,<br>
“You too are one of them”;<br>
but Peter answered, “My friend, I am not.”<br>
About an hour later, still another insisted,<br>
“Assuredly, this man too was with him,<br>
for he also is a Galilean.”<br>
But Peter said,<br>
“My friend, I do not know what you are talking about.”<br>
Just as he was saying this, the cock crowed,<br>
and the Lord turned and looked at Peter;<br>
and Peter remembered the word of the Lord,<br>
how he had said to him,<br>
“Before the cock crows today, you will deny me three times.”<br>
He went out and began to weep bitterly.<br>
The men who held Jesus in custody were ridiculing and beating him.<br>
They blindfolded him and questioned him, saying,<br>
“Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?”<br>
And they reviled him in saying many other things against him.</p>
<p>When day came the council of elders of the people met,<br>
both chief priests and scribes,<br>
and they brought him before their Sanhedrin.<br>
They said, “If you are the Christ, tell us,“<br>
but he replied to them, “If I tell you, you will not believe,<br>
and if I question, you will not respond.<br>
But from this time on the Son of Man will be seated<br>
at the right hand of the power of God.”<br>
They all asked, “Are you then the Son of God?”<br>
He replied to them, “You say that I am.”<br>
Then they said, “What further need have we for testimony?<br>
We have heard it from his own mouth.”</p>
<p>Then the whole assembly of them arose and brought him before Pilate.<br>
They brought charges against him, saying,<br>
“We found this man misleading our people;<br>
he opposes the payment of taxes to Caesar<br>
and maintains that he is the Christ, a king.”<br>
Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”<br>
He said to him in reply, “You say so.”<br>
Pilate then addressed the chief priests and the crowds,<br>
“I find this man not guilty.”<br>
But they were adamant and said,<br>
“He is inciting the people with his teaching throughout all Judea,<br>
from Galilee where he began even to here.”</p>
<p>On hearing this Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean;<br>
and upon learning that he was under Herod’s jurisdiction,<br>
he sent him to Herod who was in Jerusalem at that time.<br>
Herod was very glad to see Jesus;<br>
he had been wanting to see him for a long time,<br>
for he had heard about him<br>
and had been hoping to see him perform some sign.<br>
He questioned him at length,<br>
but he gave him no answer.<br>
The chief priests and scribes, meanwhile,<br>
stood by accusing him harshly.<br>
Herod and his soldiers treated him contemptuously and mocked him,<br>
and after clothing him in resplendent garb,<br>
he sent him back to Pilate.<br>
Herod and Pilate became friends that very day,<br>
even though they had been enemies formerly.<br>
Pilate then summoned the chief priests, the rulers, and the people<br>
and said to them, “You brought this man to me<br>
and accused him of inciting the people to revolt.<br>
I have conducted my investigation in your presence<br>
and have not found this man guilty<br>
of the charges you have brought against him,<br>
nor did Herod, for he sent him back to us.<br>
So no capital crime has been committed by him.<br>
Therefore I shall have him flogged and then release him.”</p>
<p>But all together they shouted out,<br>
“Away with this man!<br>
Release Barabbas to us.”<br>
— Now Barabbas had been imprisoned for a rebellion<br>
that had taken place in the city and for murder. —<br>
Again Pilate addressed them, still wishing to release Jesus,<br>
but they continued their shouting,<br>
“Crucify him! Crucify him!”<br>
Pilate addressed them a third time,<br>
“What evil has this man done?<br>
I found him guilty of no capital crime.<br>
Therefore I shall have him flogged and then release him.”<br>
With loud shouts, however,<br>
they persisted in calling for his crucifixion,<br>
and their voices prevailed.<br>
The verdict of Pilate was that their demand should be granted.<br>
So he released the man who had been imprisoned<br>
for rebellion and murder, for whom they asked,<br>
and he handed Jesus over to them to deal with as they wished.</p>
<p>As they led him away<br>
they took hold of a certain Simon, a Cyrenian,<br>
who was coming in from the country;<br>
and after laying the cross on him,<br>
they made him carry it behind Jesus.<br>
A large crowd of people followed Jesus,<br>
including many women who mourned and lamented him.<br>
Jesus turned to them and said,<br>
“Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me;<br>
weep instead for yourselves and for your children<br>
for indeed, the days are coming when people will say,<br>
‘Blessed are the barren,<br>
the wombs that never bore<br>
and the breasts that never nursed.’<br>
At that time people will say to the mountains,<br>
‘Fall upon us!’<br>
and to the hills, ‘Cover us!’<br>
for if these things are done when the wood is green<br>
what will happen when it is dry?”<br>
Now two others, both criminals,<br>
were led away with him to be executed.</p>
<p>When they came to the place called the Skull,<br>
they crucified him and the criminals there,<br>
one on his right, the other on his left.<br>
Then Jesus said,<br>
“Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.”<br>
They divided his garments by casting lots.<br>
The people stood by and watched;<br>
the rulers, meanwhile, sneered at him and said,<br>
“He saved others, let him save himself<br>
if he is the chosen one, the Christ of God.”<br>
Even the soldiers jeered at him.<br>
As they approached to offer him wine they called out,<br>
“If you are King of the Jews, save yourself.”<br>
Above him there was an inscription that read,<br>
“This is the King of the Jews.”</p>
<p>Now one of the criminals hanging there reviled Jesus, saying,<br>
“Are you not the Christ?<br>
Save yourself and us.”<br>
The other, however, rebuking him, said in reply,<br>
“Have you no fear of God,<br>
for you are subject to the same condemnation?<br>
And indeed, we have been condemned justly,<br>
for the sentence we received corresponds to our crimes,<br>
but this man has done nothing criminal.”<br>
Then he said,<br>
“Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.”<br>
He replied to him,<br>
“Amen, I say to you,<br>
today you will be with me in Paradise.”</p>
<p>It was now about noon and darkness came over the whole land<br>
until three in the afternoon<br>
because of an eclipse of the sun.<br>
Then the veil of the temple was torn down the middle.<br>
Jesus cried out in a loud voice,<br>
“Father, into your hands I commend my spirit”;<br>
and when he had said this he breathed his last.</p>
<p><span class="red"><em>Here all kneel and pause for a short time.</em></span></p>
<p>The centurion who witnessed what had happened glorified God and said,<br>
“This man was innocent beyond doubt.”<br>
When all the people who had gathered for this spectacle saw what had happened,<br>
they returned home beating their breasts;<br>
but all his acquaintances stood at a distance,<br>
including the women who had followed him from Galilee<br>
and saw these events.<br>
Now there was a virtuous and righteous man named Joseph who,<br>
though he was a member of the council,<br>
had not consented to their plan of action.<br>
He came from the Jewish town of Arimathea<br>
and was awaiting the kingdom of God.<br>
He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.<br>
After he had taken the body down,<br>
he wrapped it in a linen cloth<br>
and laid him in a rock-hewn tomb<br>
in which no one had yet been buried.<br>
It was the day of preparation,<br>
and the sabbath was about to begin.<br>
The women who had come from Galilee with him followed behind,<br>
and when they had seen the tomb<br>
and the way in which his body was laid in it,<br>
they returned and prepared spices and perfumed oils.<br>
Then they rested on the sabbath according to the commandment.</p>
<p><span class="red">Or:</span></p>
<p>The elders of the people, chief priests and scribes,<br>
arose and brought Jesus before Pilate.<br>
They brought charges against him, saying,<br>
“We found this man misleading our people;<br>

<li>The <strong>Gloria</strong> is omitted during Lent.</li>
<li>The Palm Sunday liturgy begins at the rear of the church. The <strong>Processional Hymn</strong> is not sung until after the first Gospel reading and the priest concludes with “<em>…let us go forth in peace.</em>”</li>
<li>If given the option, the hymn “Were You There” should be taken from GIA, either the Gather or Worship hymnal, which usually have more verses than Breaking Bread.</li>
<li>Choral anthems oﬀered are alternatives for the <strong>Meditation hymn</strong>. Palm Sunday should be coordinated with Good Friday to avoid repeating anthems.</li>
