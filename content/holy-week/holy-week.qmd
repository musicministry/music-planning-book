::: {.red}
Holy Week and the Holy Triduum are the most solemn celebrations in the
liturgical year. Because each celebration is unique, extra preparation and
attention to detail are required by all involved in order to celebrate them
properly, beautifully, and liturgically.

Important instructions for musicians are included in the **Notes** for each
liturgy in the pages that follow. The order of the liturgies can be found in the missalette section of *Breaking Bread*. It is imperative that musicians be familiar with the order of events and follow along closely to anticipate what comes next. Consult the Celebrant before each liturgy for clarifications or special instructions.
