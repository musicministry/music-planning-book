::: {.red}
According to the General Instruction of the Roman Missal, the following Sequence is chanted immediately following the Second Reading and before the Gospel Acclamation on [Pentecost Sunday](../easter/pentecost.qmd). It is not sung at the Saturday Vigil Mass.

Here, the oﬃcial approved text, as found in the Lectionary, is put to a simple psalm tone arranged by M. Grossi (©2023). A cantor version containing only the psalm melody is provided first, followed by an organ version with a suggested accompaniment arranged by M. Grossi (©2023).

### Liturgical performance notes
:::

* [The melody is simply repeated for each stanza in a fashion similar to the more-familiar singing of Responsorial Psalm verses, one line per stanza.]{.red}
* [The use of *italics* font together with an accent symbol (´) indicates
the textual syllable on which to move to the next note in the stanza.
Everything preceding this annotated syllable is chanted on the first note
of the measure. The musical timing of these sustained notes is arbitrary
and should be determined entirely by the singing, which should be done
in a smooth, chant-like fashion.]{.red}
* [The verses are arranged column-wise: Read down column one first, then the second column (verse 2 begins “*Come, O Father...*”)]{.red}

Come, O Holy Spirit, *cóme*!  
And from your cel*ést*ial home  
Shed a ray of *líght* divine!  

Come, O Father of the *póor*!  
Come, source of *áll* our store!  
Come, within our *bós*oms shine.  

You, of comforters the *bést*;  
You, the soul's most *wél*come guest;  
Sweet refreshment *hére* below;  

In our labor, rest most *swéet*;  
Grateful coolness *ín* the heat;  
Solace in the *mídst* of woe.  

O most blessed, Light di*víne*,  
Shine within these *héarts* of yours,  
And our inmost *bé*ing fill!

Where you are not, we have *náught*,  
Nothing good in *déed* or thought,  
Nothing free from *táint* of ill.  

Heal our wounds, our strength re*néw*;  
On our dryness *póur* your dew;  
Wash the stains of *gúilt* away:

Bend the stubborn heart and *wíll*;  
Melt the frozen, *wárm* the chill;  
Guide the steps that *gó* astray.

On the faithful, who a*dóre*  
And confess you, *év*ermore  
In your sev'nfold *gíft* descend;

Give them virtue's sure re*wárd*;  
Give them your sal*vá*tion, Lord;  
Give them joys that *né*ver end.

A*mén*. Al*lé*luia, Al*lé*luia.
