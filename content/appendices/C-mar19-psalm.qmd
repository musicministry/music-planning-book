::: {.red}
The following Responsorial Psalm and Gospel Acclamation can be used if the [Solemnity of Saint Joseph](../feasts/mar19-stjoseph.qmd) falls within the Season of Lent.

The Responsorial Psalm was arranged by M. Grossi.

The Lenten Gospel Acclamation refrain from OCP *Respond & Acclaim* by Owen Alstott is copyrighted by OCP, as indicated, while the verse text was arranged to a simple psalm tone by M. Grossi because none existed in *Respond & Acclaim* the year this was needed.
