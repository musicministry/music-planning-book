#### First Reading [Genesis 12:1-4a]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

The LORD said to Abram:  
“Go forth from the land of your kinsfolk  
and from your father’s house to a land that I will show you.  

“I will make of you a great nation,  
and I will bless you;  
I will make your name great,  
so that you will be a blessing.  
I will bless those who bless you  
and curse those who curse you.  
All the communities of the earth. 
shall find blessing in you.”  

Abram went as the LORD directed him.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 33:4-5, 18-19, 20, 22]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Lord, let your mercy be on us, as we place our trust in you.**  

Upright is the word of the LORD,  
and all his works are trustworthy.    
He loves justice and right;  
of the kindness of the LORD the earth is full. **[℟.]{.red}**  

See, the eyes of the LORD are upon those who fear him,  
upon those who hope for his kindness,  
To deliver them from death  
and preserve them in spite of famine. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Our soul waits for the LORD,  
who is our help and our shield.  
May your kindness, O LORD, be upon us  
who have put our hope in you. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [2 Timothy 1:8b-10]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Beloved:  
Bear your share of hardship for the gospel  
with the strength that comes from God.  

He saved us and called us to a holy life,  
not according to our works  
but according to his own design  
and the grace bestowed on us in Christ Jesus before time began,  
but now made manifest  
through the appearance of our savior Christ Jesus,  
who destroyed death and brought life and immortality  
to light through the gospel.

#### Gospel Acclamation [Matthew 17:5]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ, king of endless glory.**

This is my beloved Son, hear him. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Gospel [Matthew 17:1-9]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother,  
and led them up a high mountain by themselves.  
And he was transfigured before them;  
his face shone like the sun  
and his clothes became white as light.  
And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them,  
conversing with him.  
Then Peter said to Jesus in reply,  
“Lord, it is good that we are here.  
If you wish, I will make three tents here,  
one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”  
While he was still speaking, behold,  
a bright cloud cast a shadow over them,  
then from the cloud came a voice that said,  
“This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased;  
listen to him.”  
When the disciples heard this, they fell prostrate  
and were very much afraid.  
But Jesus came and touched them, saying,  
“Rise, and do not be afraid.”  
And when the disciples raised their eyes,  
they saw no one else but Jesus alone.  

As they were coming down from the mountain,  
Jesus charged them,  
“Do not tell the vision to anyone  
until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.”

#### First Reading [Genesis 22:1-2, 9a, 10-13, 15-18]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

God put Abraham to the test.  
He called to him, "Abraham!"  
"Here I am!" he replied.  
Then God said:  
"Take your son Isaac, your only one, whom you love,  
and go to the land of Moriah.  
There you shall offer him up as a holocaust  
on a height that I will point out to you."  

When they came to the place of which God had told him,  
Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it.  
Then he reached out and took the knife to slaughter his son.  
But the LORD's messenger called to him from heaven,  
"Abraham, Abraham!"  
"Here I am!" he answered.  
"Do not lay your hand on the boy," said the messenger.  
"Do not do the least thing to him.  
I know now how devoted you are to God,  
since you did not withhold from me your own beloved son."  
As Abraham looked about,  
he spied a ram caught by its horns in the thicket.  
So he went and took the ram  
and offered it up as a holocaust in place of his son.  

Again the LORD's messenger called to Abraham from heaven and said:  
"I swear by myself, declares the LORD,  
that because you acted as you did  
in not withholding from me your beloved son,  
I will bless you abundantly  
and make your descendants as countless  
as the stars of the sky and the sands of the seashore;  
your descendants shall take possession  
of the gates of their enemies,  
and in your descendants all the nations of the earth  
shall find blessing—  
all this because you obeyed my command."

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 116:10, 15, 16-17, 18-19]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **I will walk before the Lord, in the land of the living.**  

I believed, even when I said,  
"I am greatly afflicted."  
Precious in the eyes of the LORD  
is the death of his faithful ones. **[℟.]{.red}**  

O LORD, I am your servant;  
I am your servant, the son of your handmaid;  
you have loosed my bonds.  
To you will I offer sacrifice of thanksgiving,  
and I will call upon the name of the LORD. **[℟.]{.red}**  

My vows to the LORD I will pay  
in the presence of all his people,  
In the courts of the house of the LORD,  
in your midst, O Jerusalem. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Romans 8:31b-34]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
If God is for us, who can be against us?  
He who did not spare his own Son  
but handed him over for us all,  
how will he not also give us everything else along with him?  

Who will bring a charge against God's chosen ones?  
It is God who acquits us, who will condemn?  
Christ Jesus it is who died—or, rather, was raised—  
who also is at the right hand of God,  
who indeed intercedes for us.

**[℟.]{.red}** **Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ, king of endless glory.**

#### Gospel [Mark 9:2-10]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus took Peter, James, and John  
and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves.  
And he was transfigured before them,  
and his clothes became dazzling white,  
such as no fuller on earth could bleach them.  
Then Elijah appeared to them along with Moses,  
and they were conversing with Jesus.  
Then Peter said to Jesus in reply,  
"Rabbi, it is good that we are here!  
Let us make three tents:  
one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."  
He hardly knew what to say, they were so terrified.  
Then a cloud came, casting a shadow over them;  
from the cloud came a voice,  
"This is my beloved Son. Listen to him."  
Suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone  
but Jesus alone with them.  

As they were coming down from the mountain,  
he charged them not to relate what they had seen to anyone,  
except when the Son of Man had risen from the dead.  
So they kept the matter to themselves,  
questioning what rising from the dead meant.

#### First Reading [Genesis 15:5-12, 17-18]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

The Lord God took Abram outside and said,  
“Look up at the sky and count the stars, if you can.  
Just so,” he added, “shall your descendants be.”  
Abram put his faith in the LORD,  
who credited it to him as an act of righteousness.  

He then said to him,  
“I am the LORD who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans  
to give you this land as a possession.”  
“O Lord GOD,” he asked,  
“how am I to know that I shall possess it?”  
He answered him,  
“Bring me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old she-goat,  
a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.”  
Abram brought him all these, split them in two,  
and placed each half opposite the other;  
but the birds he did not cut up.  
Birds of prey swooped down on the carcasses,  
but Abram stayed with them.  
As the sun was about to set, a trance fell upon Abram,  
and a deep, terrifying darkness enveloped him.  

When the sun had set and it was dark,  
there appeared a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch,  
which passed between those pieces.  
It was on that occasion that the LORD made a covenant with Abram,  
saying: “To your descendants I give this land,  
from the Wadi of Egypt to the Great River, the Euphrates.”

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 27:1, 7-8, 8-9, 13-14]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **The Lord is my light and my salvation.**  

The LORD is my light and my salvation;  
&emsp; whom should I fear?  
The LORD is my life’s refuge;  
&emsp; of whom should I be afraid? **[℟.]{.red}**  

Hear, O LORD, the sound of my call;  
&emsp; have pity on me, and answer me.  
Of you my heart speaks; you my glance seeks. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Your presence, O LORD, I seek.  
&emsp; Hide not your face from me;  
do not in anger repel your servant.  
&emsp; You are my helper: cast me not off. **[℟.]{.red}**  

I believe that I shall see the bounty of the LORD  
&emsp; in the land of the living.  
Wait for the LORD with courage;  
&emsp; be stouthearted, and wait for the LORD. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Philippians 3:17—4:1 or 3:20—4:1]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Join with others in being imitators of me, brothers and sisters,  
and observe those who thus conduct themselves  
according to the model you have in us.  
For many, as I have often told you  
and now tell you even in tears,  
conduct themselves as enemies of the cross of Christ.  
Their end is destruction.  
Their God is their stomach;  
their glory is in their “shame.”  
Their minds are occupied with earthly things.  
But our citizenship is in heaven,  
and from it we also await a savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.  
He will change our lowly body  
to conform with his glorified body  
by the power that enables him also  
to bring all things into subjection to himself.  

Therefore, my brothers and sisters,  
whom I love and long for, my joy and crown,  
in this way stand firm in the Lord.

#### Gospel [Luke 9:28b-36]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus took Peter, John, and James  
and went up the mountain to pray.  
While he was praying his face changed in appearance  
and his clothing became dazzling white.  
And behold, two men were conversing with him, Moses and Elijah,  
who appeared in glory and spoke of his exodus  
that he was going to accomplish in Jerusalem.  
Peter and his companions had been overcome by sleep,  
but becoming fully awake,  
they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.  
As they were about to part from him, Peter said to Jesus,  
“Master, it is good that we are here;  
let us make three tents,  
one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”  
But he did not know what he was saying.  
While he was still speaking,  
a cloud came and cast a shadow over them,  
and they became frightened when they entered the cloud.  
Then from the cloud came a voice that said,  
“This is my chosen Son; listen to him.”  
After the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone.  
They fell silent and did not at that time  
tell anyone what they had seen.
