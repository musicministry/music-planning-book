The [Mass of Charity and Love]{.black} by Steven Werner and based on the hymn "[Where Charity and Love Prevail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbeJrA8Lp3s)," is used during Lent for all years (A, B, C) unless otherwise noted in the Notes for a specific liturgy or occasion:
:::

::: {.titlered}
### &nbsp; Year A, B, C
:::
{{< var text.yearabc >}}

```{python}
#| title: Year ABC
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
utils.masssetting(params['mass']['abc'], urls=videos)
```

::: {.red}
(This Mass setting, published by GiA, will need to be purchased for public liturgical use if not contained in the parish hymnal.)

The hymn selections provided herein for the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Sundays of Lent are catered to the regular readings for these weekends. If the Scutinies are celebrated, diï¬€erent readings, Responsorial Psalms, and Gospel Acclamations will be used. Some adaptations to the music list may be warranted or prudent in this case. Refer to the section [**Hymn Selection: A Heuristic**](../about-book.qmd#hymn-selection-a-heuristic) for guidance on selecting hymns.
