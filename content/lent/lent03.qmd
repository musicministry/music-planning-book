### &nbsp; Year A

#### First Reading [Exodus 17:3-7]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

In those days, in their thirst for water,  
the people grumbled against Moses,  
saying, “Why did you ever make us leave Egypt?  
Was it just to have us die here of thirst  
with our children and our livestock?”  
So Moses cried out to the LORD,  
“What shall I do with this people?  
a little more and they will stone me!”  
The LORD answered Moses,  
“Go over there in front of the people,  
along with some of the elders of Israel,  
holding in your hand, as you go,  
the staff with which you struck the river. 
I will be standing there in front of you on the rock in Horeb.  
Strike the rock, and the water will flow from it  
for the people to drink.”  
This Moses did, in the presence of the elders of Israel.  
The place was called Massah and Meribah,  
because the Israelites quarreled there  
and tested the LORD, saying,  
“Is the LORD in our midst or not?”

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 95:1-2, 6-7, 8-9]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts.**  

Come, let us sing joyfully to the LORD;  
&emsp; let us acclaim the Rock of our salvation.  
Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving;  
&emsp; let us joyfully sing psalms to him. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Come, let us bow down in worship;  
&emsp; let us kneel before the LORD who made us.  
For he is our God,  
&emsp; and we are the people he shepherds, the flock he guides. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Oh, that today you would hear his voice:  
&emsp; “Harden not your hearts as at Meribah,  
&emsp; as in the day of Massah in the desert,  
Where your fathers tempted me;  
&emsp; they tested me though they had seen my works.” **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Romans 5:1-2, 5-8]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
Since we have been justified by faith,  
we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,  
through whom we have gained access by faith  
to this grace in which we stand,  
and we boast in hope of the glory of God.  

And hope does not disappoint,  
because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts  
through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.  
For Christ, while we were still helpless,  
died at the appointed time for the ungodly.  
Indeed, only with difficulty does one die for a just person,  
though perhaps for a good person one might even find courage to die.  
But God proves his love for us  
in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us.

Lord, you are truly the Savior of the world;

#### Gospel [John 4:5-42 or 4:5-15, 19b-26, 39a, 40-42]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus came to a town of Samaria called Sychar,  
near the plot of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.  
Jacob’s well was there.  
Jesus, tired from his journey, sat down there at the well.  
It was about noon.  

A woman of Samaria came to draw water.  
Jesus said to her,  
“Give me a drink.”  
His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.  
The Samaritan woman said to him,  
“How can you, a Jew, ask me, a Samaritan woman, for a drink?”  
—For Jews use nothing in common with Samaritans.—  
Jesus answered and said to her,  
“If you knew the gift of God  
and who is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,‘  
you would have asked him  
and he would have given you living water.”  
The woman said to him,  
“Sir, you do not even have a bucket and the cistern is deep;  
where then can you get this living water?  
Are you greater than our father Jacob,  
who gave us this cistern and drank from it himself  
with his children and his flocks?”  
Jesus answered and said to her,  
“Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again;  
but whoever drinks the water I shall give will never thirst;  
the water I shall give will become in him  
a spring of water welling up to eternal life.”  
The woman said to him,  
“Sir, give me this water, so that I may not be thirsty  
or have to keep coming here to draw water.”  

Jesus said to her,  
“Go call your husband and come back.”  
The woman answered and said to him,  
“I do not have a husband.”  
Jesus answered her,  
“You are right in saying, ‘I do not have a husband.’  
For you have had five husbands,  
and the one you have now is not your husband.  
What you have said is true.”  
The woman said to him,  
“Sir, I can see that you are a prophet.  
Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain;   
but you people say that the place to worship is in Jerusalem.”  
Jesus said to her,  
“Believe me, woman, the hour is coming  
when you will worship the Father  
neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.  
You people worship what you do not understand;  
we worship what we understand,  
because salvation is from the Jews.  
But the hour is coming, and is now here,  
when true worshipers will worship the Father in Spirit and truth;  
and indeed the Father seeks such people to worship him.  
God is Spirit, and those who worship him  
must worship in Spirit and truth.”  
The woman said to him,  
“I know that the Messiah is coming, the one called the Christ;  
when he comes, he will tell us everything.”  
Jesus said to her,  
“I am he, the one speaking with you.”  

At that moment his disciples returned,  
and were amazed that he was talking with a woman,  
but still no one said, “What are you looking for?”  
or “Why are you talking with her?”  
The woman left her water jar  
and went into the town and said to the people,  
“Come see a man who told me everything I have done.  
Could he possibly be the Christ?”  
They went out of the town and came to him.  
Meanwhile, the disciples urged him, “Rabbi, eat.”  
But he said to them,  
“I have food to eat of which you do not know.”  
So the disciples said to one another,  
“Could someone have brought him something to eat?”  
Jesus said to them,  
“My food is to do the will of the one who sent me  
and to finish his work.  
Do you not say, ‘In four months the harvest will be here’?  
I tell you, look up and see the fields ripe for the harvest.  
The reaper is already receiving payment  
and gathering crops for eternal life,  
so that the sower and reaper can rejoice together.  
For here the saying is verified that ‘One sows and another reaps.’  
I sent you to reap what you have not worked for;  
others have done the work,  
and you are sharing the fruits of their work.”  

Many of the Samaritans of that town began to believe in him  
because of the word of the woman who testified,  
“He told me everything I have done.”  
When the Samaritans came to him,  

they invited him to stay with them;   
and he stayed there two days.  
Many more began to believe in him because of his word,  
and they said to the woman,  
“We no longer believe because of your word;  
for we have heard for ourselves,  
and we know that this is truly the savior of the world.”

:::

In those days, God delivered all these commandments:  
“I, the LORD, am your God,  
who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that place of slavery.  
You shall not have other gods besides me.  
You shall not carve idols for yourselves  
in the shape of anything in the sky above  
or on the earth below or in the waters beneath the earth;  
you shall not bow down before them or worship them.  
For I, the LORD, your God, am a jealous God,  
inflicting punishment for their fathers’ wickedness  
on the children of those who hate me,  
down to the third and fourth generation;  
but bestowing mercy down to the thousandth generation  
on the children of those who love me and keep my commandments.  

“You shall not take the name of the LORD, your God, in vain.  
For the LORD will not leave unpunished  
the one who takes his name in vain.  

“Remember to keep holy the sabbath day.  
Six days you may labor and do all your work,  
but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD, your God.  
No work may be done then either by you, or your son or daughter,  
or your male or female slave, or your beast,  
or by the alien who lives with you.  
In six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth,  
the sea and all that is in them;  
but on the seventh day he rested.  
That is why the LORD has blessed the sabbath day and made it holy.

“Honor your father and your mother,  
that you may have a long life in the land  
which the LORD, your God, is giving you.  
You shall not kill.  
You shall not commit adultery.  
You shall not steal.  
You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.  
You shall not covet your neighbor’s house.  
You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife,  
nor his male or female slave, nor his ox or ass,  
nor anything else that belongs to him.”

The precepts of the LORD are right,

Brothers and sisters:  
Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom,  
but we proclaim Christ crucified,  
a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles,  
but to those who are called, Jews and Greeks alike,  
Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.  
For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom,  
and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.

Since the Passover of the Jews was near,  
Jesus went up to Jerusalem.  
He found in the temple area those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves,  
as well as the money changers seated there.  
He made a whip out of cords  
and drove them all out of the temple area, with the sheep and oxen,  
and spilled the coins of the money changers  
and overturned their tables,  
and to those who sold doves he said,  
“Take these out of here,  
and stop making my Father’s house a marketplace.”  
His disciples recalled the words of Scripture,  
*Zeal for your house will consume me.*  
At this the Jews answered and said to him,  
“What sign can you show us for doing this?”  
Jesus answered and said to them,  
“Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.”  
The Jews said,  
“This temple has been under construction for forty-six years,  
and you will raise it up in three days?”  
But he was speaking about the temple of his body.  
Therefore, when he was raised from the dead,  
his disciples remembered that he had said this,  
and they came to believe the Scripture  
and the word Jesus had spoken.  

While he was in Jerusalem for the feast of Passover,  
many began to believe in his name  
when they saw the signs he was doing.  
But Jesus would not trust himself to them because he knew them all,  
and did not need anyone to testify about human nature.  
He himself understood it well.

:::

Moses was tending the flock of his father-in-law Jethro,  
the priest of Midian.  
Leading the flock across the desert, he came to Horeb,  
the mountain of God.  
There an angel of the LORD appeared to Moses in fire  
flaming out of a bush.  
As he looked on, he was surprised to see that the bush,  
though on fire, was not consumed.  
So Moses decided,  
“I must go over to look at this remarkable sight,  
and see why the bush is not burned.”  

When the LORD saw him coming over to look at it more closely,  
God called out to him from the bush, "Moses! Moses!”  
He answered, “Here I am.”  
God said, “Come no nearer!  
Remove the sandals from your feet,  
for the place where you stand is holy ground.  
I am the God of your fathers,“ he continued,  
“the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob.”  
Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.  
But the LORD said,  
“I have witnessed the affliction of my people in Egypt  
and have heard their cry of complaint against their slave drivers,  
so I know well what they are suffering.  
Therefore I have come down to rescue them  
from the hands of the Egyptians  
and lead them out of that land into a good and spacious land,  
a land flowing with milk and honey.”  

Moses said to God, “But when I go to the Israelites  
and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’  
if they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what am I to tell them?”  
God replied, “I am who am.”  
Then he added, “This is what you shall tell the Israelites:  
I AM sent me to you.”  

God spoke further to Moses, “Thus shall you say to the Israelites:  
The LORD, the God of your fathers,  
the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob,  
has sent me to you.  

“This is my name forever;  
thus am I to be remembered through all generations.”

I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters,  
that our ancestors were all under the cloud  
and all passed through the sea,  
and all of them were baptized into Moses  
in the cloud and in the sea.  
All ate the same spiritual food,  
and all drank the same spiritual drink,  
for they drank from a spiritual rock that followed them,  
and the rock was the Christ.  
Yet God was not pleased with most of them,  
for they were struck down in the desert.  

These things happened as examples for us,  
so that we might not desire evil things, as they did.  
Do not grumble as some of them did,  
and suffered death by the destroyer.  
These things happened to them as an example,  
and they have been written down as a warning to us,  
upon whom the end of the ages has come.  
Therefore, whoever thinks he is standing secure  
should take care not to fall.

#### Gospel [Luke 13:1-9]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Some people told Jesus about the Galileans  
whose blood Pilate had mingled with the blood of their sacrifices.  
Jesus said to them in reply,  
“Do you think that because these Galileans suffered in this way  
they were greater sinners than all other Galileans?  
By no means!  
But I tell you, if you do not repent,  
you will all perish as they did!  
Or those eighteen people who were killed  
when the tower at Siloam fell on them—  
do you think they were more guilty  
than everyone else who lived in Jerusalem?  
By no means!  
But I tell you, if you do not repent,  
you will all perish as they did!”  

And he told them this parable:  
“There once was a person who had a fig tree planted in his orchard,  
and when he came in search of fruit on it but found none,  
he said to the gardener,  
‘For three years now I have come in search of fruit on this fig tree  
but have found none.  
So cut it down.  
Why should it exhaust the soil?’  
He said to him in reply,  
‘Sir, leave it for this year also,  
and I shall cultivate the ground around it and fertilize it;  
it may bear fruit in the future.  
If not you can cut it down.’”
