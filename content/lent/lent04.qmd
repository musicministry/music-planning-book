#### First Reading [1 Samuel 16:1b, 6-7, 10-13a]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

The LORD said to Samuel:  
“Fill your horn with oil, and be on your way.  
I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem,  
for I have chosen my king from among his sons.”  

As Jesse and his sons came to the sacrifice,  
Samuel looked at Eliab and thought,  
“Surely the LORD’s anointed is here before him.”  
But the LORD said to Samuel:  
“Do not judge from his appearance or from his lofty stature,  
because I have rejected him.  
Not as man sees does God see,  
because man sees the appearance  
but the LORD looks into the heart.”  
In the same way Jesse presented seven sons before Samuel,  
but Samuel said to Jesse,  
“The LORD has not chosen any one of these.”  
Then Samuel asked Jesse,  
“Are these all the sons you have?”  
Jesse replied,  
“There is still the youngest, who is tending the sheep.”  
Samuel said to Jesse,  
“Send for him;  
we will not begin the sacrificial banquet until he arrives here.”  
Jesse sent and had the young man brought to them.  
He was ruddy, a youth handsome to behold  
and making a splendid appearance.  
The LORD said,  
“There—anoint him, for this is the one!”  
Then Samuel, with the horn of oil in hand,   
anointed David in the presence of his brothers;  
and from that day on, the spirit of the LORD rushed upon David.

**[℟.]{.red}** **The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.**  

The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.  
&emsp; In verdant pastures he gives me repose;  
beside restful waters he leads me;  
&emsp; he refreshes my soul. **[℟.]{.red}**  

He guides me in right paths  
&emsp; for his name’s sake.  
Even though I walk in the dark valley  
&emsp; I fear no evil; for you are at my side  
With your rod and your staff  
&emsp; that give me courage. **[℟.]{.red}**  

You spread the table before me  
&emsp; in the sight of my foes;  
you anoint my head with oil;  
&emsp; my cup overflows. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Only goodness and kindness follow me  
&emsp; all the days of my life;  
and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD  
&emsp; for years to come. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Ephesians 5:8-14]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
You were once darkness,   
but now you are light in the Lord.  
Live as children of light,  
for light produces every kind of goodness  
and righteousness and truth.  
Try to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.  
Take no part in the fruitless works of darkness;  
rather expose them, for it is shameful even to mention  
the things done by them in secret;  
but everything exposed by the light becomes visible,  
for everything that becomes visible is light.  
Therefore, it says:  
&emsp; “Awake, O sleeper,  
&emsp; and arise from the dead,  
&emsp; and Christ will give you light.”

#### Gospel [John 9:1-41 or 9:1, 6-9, 13-17, 34-38]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

As Jesus passed by he saw a man blind from birth.  
His disciples asked him,  
“Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents,  
that he was born blind?”  
Jesus answered,  
“Neither he nor his parents sinned;  
it is so that the works of God might be made visible through him.  
We have to do the works of the one who sent me while it is day.  
Night is coming when no one can work.  
While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”  
When he had said this, he spat on the ground  
and made clay with the saliva,  
and smeared the clay on his eyes,  
and said to him,  
“Go wash in the Pool of Siloam” —which means Sent.  
So he went and washed, and came back able to see.  

His neighbors and those who had seen him earlier as a beggar said,  
“Isn’t this the one who used to sit and beg?”  
Some said, “It is,“  
but others said, “No, he just looks like him.”  
He said, “I am.”  
So they said to him, “How were your eyes opened?”  
He replied,  
“The man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes  
and told me, ‘Go to Siloam and wash.’  
So I went there and washed and was able to see.”  
And they said to him, “Where is he?”  
He said, “I don’t know.”  

They brought the one who was once blind to the Pharisees.  
Now Jesus had made clay and opened his eyes on a sabbath.  
So then the Pharisees also asked him how he was able to see.  
He said to them,  
“He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and now I can see.”  
So some of the Pharisees said,  
“This man is not from God,  
because he does not keep the sabbath.”  
But others said,  
“How can a sinful man do such signs?”  
And there was a division among them.  
So they said to the blind man again,  
“What do you have to say about him,  
since he opened your eyes?”  
He said, “He is a prophet.”  

Now the Jews did not believe  
that he had been blind and gained his sight  
until they summoned the parents of the one who had gained his sight.  
They asked them,  
“Is this your son, who you say was born blind?  
How does he now see?”  
His parents answered and said,  
“We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.  
We do not know how he sees now,  
nor do we know who opened his eyes.  
Ask him, he is of age;  
he can speak for himself.”  
His parents said this because they were afraid  
of the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed  
that if anyone acknowledged him as the Christ,  
he would be expelled from the synagogue.  
For this reason his parents said,  
“He is of age; question him.”  

So a second time they called the man who had been blind  
and said to him, “Give God the praise!  
We know that this man is a sinner.”  
He replied,  
“If he is a sinner, I do not know.  
One thing I do know is that I was blind and now I see.”  
So they said to him,  
“What did he do to you?  
How did he open your eyes?”  
He answered them,  
“I told you already and you did not listen.  
Why do you want to hear it again?  
Do you want to become his disciples, too?”  
They ridiculed him and said,  
“You are that man’s disciple;  
we are disciples of Moses!  
We know that God spoke to Moses,  
but we do not know where this one is from.”  
The man answered and said to them,  
“This is what is so amazing,  
that you do not know where he is from, yet he opened my eyes.  
We know that God does not listen to sinners,  
but if one is devout and does his will, he listens to him.  
It is unheard of that anyone ever opened the eyes of a person born blind.  
If this man were not from God,  
he would not be able to do anything.”  
They answered and said to him,  
“You were born totally in sin,  
and are you trying to teach us?”  
Then they threw him out.  

When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out,  
he found him and said, Do you believe in the Son of Man?”  
He answered and said,  
“Who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?”  
Jesus said to him,  
“You have seen him,  
the one speaking with you is he.”  
He said,  
“I do believe, Lord,” and he worshiped him.  
Then Jesus said,  
“I came into this world for judgment,   
so that those who do not see might see,  
and those who do see might become blind.”  

Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this  
and said to him, “Surely we are not also blind, are we?”  
Jesus said to them,  
“If you were blind, you would have no sin;  
but now you are saying, ‘We see,’ so your sin remains.

#### First Reading [2 Chronicles 36:14-16, 19-23]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

In those days, all the princes of Judah, the priests, and the people  
added infidelity to infidelity,  
practicing all the abominations of the nations  
and polluting the LORD’s temple  
which he had consecrated in Jerusalem.  

Early and often did the LORD, the God of their fathers,  
send his messengers to them,  
for he had compassion on his people and his dwelling place.  
But they mocked the messengers of God,  
despised his warnings, and scoffed at his prophets,  
until the anger of the LORD against his people was so inflamed  
that there was no remedy.  
Their enemies burnt the house of God,  
tore down the walls of Jerusalem,  
set all its palaces afire,  
and destroyed all its precious objects.  
Those who escaped the sword were carried captive to Babylon,  
where they became servants of the king of the Chaldeans and his sons  
until the kingdom of the Persians came to power.  
All this was to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken by Jeremiah:  
“Until the land has retrieved its lost sabbaths,  
during all the time it lies waste it shall have rest  
while seventy years are fulfilled.”  

In the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia,  
in order to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken by Jeremiah,  
the LORD inspired King Cyrus of Persia  
to issue this proclamation throughout his kingdom,  
both by word of mouth and in writing:  
“Thus says Cyrus, king of Persia:  
All the kingdoms of the earth  
the LORD, the God of heaven, has given to me,  
and he has also charged me to build him a house  
in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.  
Whoever, therefore, among you belongs to any part of his people,  
let him go up, and may his God be with him!”

**[℟.]{.red}** **Let my tongue be silenced, if I ever forget you!**  

By the streams of Babylon  
&emsp; we sat and wept  
&emsp; when we remembered Zion.  
On the aspens of that land  
&emsp; we hung up our harps. **[℟.]{.red}**  

For there our captors asked of us  
&emsp; the lyrics of our songs,  
And our despoilers urged us to be joyous:  
&emsp; “Sing for us the songs of Zion!” **[℟.]{.red}**  

How could we sing a song of the LORD  
&emsp; in a foreign land?  
If I forget you, Jerusalem,  
&emsp; may my right hand be forgotten! **[℟.]{.red}**  

May my tongue cleave to my palate  
&emsp; if I remember you not,  
If I place not Jerusalem  
&emsp; ahead of my joy. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Ephesians 2:4-10]{style="float:right" .small}

Brothers and sisters:  
God, who is rich in mercy,  
because of the great love he had for us,  
even when we were dead in our transgressions,  
brought us to life with Christ — by grace you have been saved —,  
raised us up with him,  
and seated us with him in the heavens in Christ Jesus,  
that in the ages to come  
He might show the immeasurable riches of his grace  
in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.  
For by grace you have been saved through faith,  
and this is not from you; it is the gift of God;  
it is not from works, so no one may boast.  
For we are his handiwork, created in Christ Jesus for the good works  
that God has prepared in advance,  
that we should live in them.

**[℟.]{.red}** **Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ, king of endless glory.**

:::

Jesus said to Nicodemus:  
“Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert,  
so must the Son of Man be lifted up,  
so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.”  

For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son,  
so that everyone who believes in him might not perish  
but might have eternal life.  
For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world,  
but that the world might be saved through him.  
Whoever believes in him will not be condemned,  
but whoever does not believe has already been condemned,  
because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.  
And this is the verdict,  
that the light came into the world,  
but people preferred darkness to light,  
because their works were evil.  
For everyone who does wicked things hates the light  
and does not come toward the light,  
so that his works might not be exposed.  
But whoever lives the truth comes to the light,  
so that his works may be clearly seen as done in God.

The LORD said to Joshua,  
“Today I have removed the reproach of Egypt from you.”  

While the Israelites were encamped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho,  
they celebrated the Passover  
on the evening of the fourteenth of the month.  
On the day after the Passover,  
they ate of the produce of the land  
in the form of unleavened cakes and parched grain.  
On that same day after the Passover,  
on which they ate of the produce of the land, the manna ceased.  
No longer was there manna for the Israelites,  
who that year ate of the yield of the land of Canaan.

Brothers and sisters:  
Whoever is in Christ is a new creation:  
the old things have passed away;  
behold, new things have come.  
And all this is from God,  
who has reconciled us to himself through Christ  
and given us the ministry of reconciliation,  
namely, God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ,  
not counting their trespasses against them  
and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.  
So we are ambassadors for Christ,  
as if God were appealing through us.  
We implore you on behalf of Christ,  
be reconciled to God.  
For our sake he made him to be sin who did not know sin,  
so that we might become the righteousness of God in him.

:::

Tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to listen to Jesus,  
but the Pharisees and scribes began to complain, saying,  
“This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”  
So to them Jesus addressed this parable:  
“A man had two sons, and the younger son said to his father,  
‘Father give me the share of your estate that should come to me.’  
So the father divided the property between them.  
After a few days, the younger son collected all his belongings  
and set off to a distant country  
where he squandered his inheritance on a life of dissipation.  
When he had freely spent everything,  
a severe famine struck that country,  
and he found himself in dire need.  
So he hired himself out to one of the local citizens  
who sent him to his farm to tend the swine.  
And he longed to eat his fill of the pods on which the swine fed,  
but nobody gave him any.  
Coming to his senses he thought,  
‘How many of my father’s hired workers  
have more than enough food to eat,   
but here am I, dying from hunger.  
I shall get up and go to my father and I shall say to him,  
“Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.  
I no longer deserve to be called your son;  
treat me as you would treat one of your hired workers.”’  
So he got up and went back to his father.  
While he was still a long way off,  
his father caught sight of him, and was filled with compassion.  
He ran to his son, embraced him and kissed him.  
His son said to him,  
‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you;  
I no longer deserve to be called your son.’  
But his father ordered his servants,  
‘Quickly bring the finest robe and put it on him;  
put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.  
Take the fattened calf and slaughter it.  
Then let us celebrate with a feast,  
because this son of mine was dead, and has come to life again;  
he was lost, and has been found.’  
Then the celebration began.  
Now the older son had been out in the field  
and, on his way back, as he neared the house,  
he heard the sound of music and dancing.  
He called one of the servants and asked what this might mean.  
The servant said to him,  
‘Your brother has returned  
and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf  
because he has him back safe and sound.’  
He became angry,  
and when he refused to enter the house,  
his father came out and pleaded with him.  
He said to his father in reply,  
‘Look, all these years I served you  
and not once did I disobey your orders;  
yet you never gave me even a young goat to feast on with my friends.  
But when your son returns  
who swallowed up your property with prostitutes,  
for him you slaughter the fattened calf.’  
He said to him,  
‘My son, you are here with me always;  
everything I have is yours.  
But now we must celebrate and rejoice,  
because your brother was dead and has come to life again;  
he was lost and has been found.’”
