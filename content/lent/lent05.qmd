Thus says the Lord GOD:  
O my people, I will open your graves  
and have you rise from them,  
and bring you back to the land of Israel.  
Then you shall know that I am the LORD,  
when I open your graves and have you rise from them,  
O my people!  
I will put my spirit in you that you may live,  
and I will settle you upon your land;

:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **With the Lord there is mercy and fullness of redemption.**  

Out of the depths I cry to you, O LORD;  
&emsp; LORD, hear my voice!  
Let your ears be attentive  
&emsp; to my voice in supplication. **[℟.]{.red}**  

If you, O LORD, mark iniquities,  
&emsp; LORD, who can stand?  
But with you is forgiveness,  
&emsp; that you may be revered. **[℟.]{.red}**  

I trust in the LORD;  
&emsp; my soul trusts in his word.  
More than sentinels wait for the dawn,  
&emsp; let Israel wait for the LORD. **[℟.]{.red}**  

For with the LORD is kindness

And he will redeem Israel

#### Second Reading [Romans 8:8-11]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.  
But you are not in the flesh;  
on the contrary, you are in the spirit,  
if only the Spirit of God dwells in you.  
Whoever does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him.  
But if Christ is in you,  
although the body is dead because of sin,  
the spirit is alive because of righteousness.  
If the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you,  
the one who raised Christ from the dead  
will give life to your mortal bodies also,  
through his Spirit dwelling in you.

#### Gospel [John 11:1-45 or 11:3-7, 17, 20-27, 33b-45]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Now a man was ill, Lazarus from Bethany,  
the village of Mary and her sister Martha.  
Mary was the one who had anointed the Lord with perfumed oil  
and dried his feet with her hair;  
it was her brother Lazarus who was ill.  
So the sisters sent word to him saying,  
“Master, the one you love is ill.”  
When Jesus heard this he said,  
“This illness is not to end in death,  
but is for the glory of God,  
that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”  
Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.  
So when he heard that he was ill,  
he remained for two days in the place where he was.  
Then after this he said to his disciples,  
“Let us go back to Judea.”  
The disciples said to him,  
“Rabbi, the Jews were just trying to stone you,  
and you want to go back there?”  
Jesus answered,  
“Are there not twelve hours in a day?  
If one walks during the day, he does not stumble,  
because he sees the light of this world.  
But if one walks at night, he stumbles,  
because the light is not in him.”  
He said this, and then told them,  
“Our friend Lazarus is asleep,  
but I am going to awaken him.”  
So the disciples said to him,  
“Master, if he is asleep, he will be saved.”  
But Jesus was talking about his death,  
while they thought that he meant ordinary sleep.  
So then Jesus said to them clearly,  
“Lazarus has died.  
And I am glad for you that I was not there,  
that you may believe.  
Let us go to him.”  
So Thomas, called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples,  
“Let us also go to die with him.”  

When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus  
had already been in the tomb for four days.  
Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, only about two miles away.  
And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary  
to comfort them about their brother.  
When Martha heard that Jesus was coming,  
she went to meet him;  
but Mary sat at home.  
Martha said to Jesus,  
“Lord, if you had been here,  
my brother would not have died.  
But even now I know that whatever you ask of God,  
God will give you.”  
Jesus said to her,  
“Your brother will rise.”  
Martha said to him,  
“I know he will rise,  
in the resurrection on the last day.”  
Jesus told her,  
“I am the resurrection and the life;  
whoever believes in me, even if he dies, will live,  
and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die.  
Do you believe this?”  
She said to him, “Yes, Lord.  
I have come to believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God,  
the one who is coming into the world.”  

When she had said this,  
she went and called her sister Mary secretly, saying,  
“The teacher is here and is asking for you.”  
As soon as she heard this,  
she rose quickly and went to him.  
For Jesus had not yet come into the village,  
but was still where Martha had met him.  
So when the Jews who were with her in the house comforting her  
saw Mary get up quickly and go out,  
they followed her,  
presuming that she was going to the tomb to weep there.  
When Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him,  
she fell at his feet and said to him,  
“Lord, if you had been here,  
my brother would not have died.”  
When Jesus saw her weeping and the Jews who had come with her weeping,  
he became perturbed and deeply troubled, and said,  
“Where have you laid him?”  
They said to him, “Sir, come and see.”  
And Jesus wept.  
So the Jews said, “See how he loved him.”  
But some of them said,  
“Could not the one who opened the eyes of the blind man  
have done something so that this man would not have died?”  

So Jesus, perturbed again, came to the tomb.  
It was a cave, and a stone lay across it.  
Jesus said, “Take away the stone.”  
Martha, the dead man’s sister, said to him,  
“Lord, by now there will be a stench;  
he has been dead for four days.”  
Jesus said to her,  
“Did I not tell you that if you believe  
you will see the glory of God?”  
So they took away the stone.  
And Jesus raised his eyes and said,  
“Father, I thank you for hearing me.  
I know that you always hear me;  
but because of the crowd here I have said this,  
that they may believe that you sent me.”  
And when he had said this,  
He cried out in a loud voice,  
“Lazarus, come out!”  
The dead man came out,  
tied hand and foot with burial bands,  
and his face was wrapped in a cloth.  
So Jesus said to them,  
“Untie him and let him go.”  

Now many of the Jews who had come to Mary  
and seen what he had done began to believe in him.  

[Or:]{.red}  

The sisters of Lazarus sent word to Jesus, saying,  
“Master, the one you love is ill.”  
When Jesus heard this he said,  
“This illness is not to end in death,  
but is for the glory of God,  
that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”

Do you believe this?”  
She said to him, “Yes, Lord.  
I have come to believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God,  
the one who is coming into the world.”

#### First Reading [Jeremiah 31:31-34]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

The days are coming, says the LORD,  
when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel  
and the house of Judah.  
It will not be like the covenant I made with their fathers  
the day I took them by the hand  
to lead them forth from the land of Egypt;  
for they broke my covenant,  
and I had to show myself their master, says the LORD.  
But this is the covenant that I will make  
with the house of Israel after those days, says the LORD.  
I will place my law within them and write it upon their hearts;  
I will be their God, and they shall be my people.  
No longer will they have need to teach their friends and relatives  
how to know the LORD.  
All, from least to greatest, shall know me, says the LORD,  
for I will forgive their evildoing and remember their sin no more.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 51:3-4, 12-13, 14-15]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Create a clean heart in me, O God.**  

Have mercy on me, O God, in your goodness;  
&emsp; in the greatness of your compassion wipe out my offense.  
Thoroughly wash me from my guilt  
&emsp; and of my sin cleanse me. **[℟.]{.red}**  

A clean heart create for me, O God,  
&emsp; and a steadfast spirit renew within me.  
Cast me not out from your presence,  
&emsp; and your Holy Spirit take not from me. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Give me back the joy of your salvation,  
&emsp; and a willing spirit sustain in me.  
I will teach transgressors your ways,  
&emsp; and sinners shall return to you. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Hebrews 5:7-9]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

In the days when Christ Jesus was in the flesh,  
he offered prayers and supplications with loud cries and tears  
to the one who was able to save him from death,  
and he was heard because of his reverence.  
Son though he was, he learned obedience from what he suffered;  
and when he was made perfect,  
he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him.

**[℟.]{.red}** **Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ, king of endless glory.**

#### Gospel [Jn 12:20-33]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Some Greeks who had come to worship at the Passover Feast  
came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee,  
and asked him, “Sir, we would like to see Jesus.”  
Philip went and told Andrew;  
then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus.  
Jesus answered them,  
“The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.  
Amen, amen, I say to you,  
unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies,  
it remains just a grain of wheat;  
but if it dies, it produces much fruit.  
Whoever loves his life loses it,  
and whoever hates his life in this world  
will preserve it for eternal life.  
Whoever serves me must follow me,  
and where I am, there also will my servant be.  
The Father will honor whoever serves me.  

“I am troubled now.  Yet what should I say?  
‘Father, save me from this hour’?  
But it was for this purpose that I came to this hour.  
Father, glorify your name.”  
Then a voice came from heaven,  
“I have glorified it and will glorify it again.”  
The crowd there heard it and said it was thunder;  
but others said, “An angel has spoken to him.”  
Jesus answered and said,  
“This voice did not come for my sake but for yours.  
Now is the time of judgment on this world;  
now the ruler of this world will be driven out.  
And when I am lifted up from the earth,  
I will draw everyone to myself.”  
He said this indicating the kind of death he would die.

#### First Reading [Isaiah 43:16-21]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Thus says the LORD,  
&emsp; who opens a way in the sea  
&emsp; and a path in the mighty waters,  
who leads out chariots and horsemen,  
&emsp; a powerful army,  
till they lie prostrate together, never to rise,  
&emsp; snuffed out and quenched like a wick.  
Remember not the events of the past,  
&emsp; the things of long ago consider not;  
see, I am doing something new!  
&emsp; Now it springs forth, do you not perceive it?  
In the desert I make a way,  
&emsp; in the wasteland, rivers.  
Wild beasts honor me,  
&emsp; jackals and ostriches,  
for I put water in the desert  
&emsp; and rivers in the wasteland  
&emsp; for my chosen people to drink,  
the people whom I formed for myself,  
&emsp; that they might announce my praise.

**[℟.]{.red}** **The Lord has done great things for us; we are filled with joy.**  

When the LORD brought back the captives of Zion,  
&emsp; we were like men dreaming.  
Then our mouth was filled with laughter,  
&emsp; and our tongue with rejoicing. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Then they said among the nations,  
&emsp; “The LORD has done great things for them.”  
The LORD has done great things for us;  
&emsp; we are glad indeed. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Restore our fortunes, O LORD,  
&emsp; like the torrents in the southern desert.  
Those that sow in tears  
&emsp; shall reap rejoicing. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Although they go forth weeping,  
&emsp; carrying the seed to be sown,  
They shall come back rejoicing,  
&emsp; carrying their sheaves. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Philippians 3:8-14]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
I consider everything as a loss  
because of the supreme good of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.  
For his sake I have accepted the loss of all things  
and I consider them so much rubbish,  
that I may gain Christ and be found in him,  
not having any righteousness of my own based on the law  
but that which comes through faith in Christ,  
the righteousness from God,  
depending on faith to know him and the power of his resurrection  
and the sharing of his sufferings by being conformed to his death,  
if somehow I may attain the resurrection from the dead.  

It is not that I have already taken hold of it  
or have already attained perfect maturity,  
but I continue my pursuit in hope that I may possess it,  
since I have indeed been taken possession of by Christ Jesus.  
Brothers and sisters, I for my part  
do not consider myself to have taken possession.  
Just one thing: forgetting what lies behind  
but straining forward to what lies ahead,  
I continue my pursuit toward the goal,  
the prize of God’s upward calling, in Christ Jesus.

:::

Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.  
But early in the morning he arrived again in the temple area,  
and all the people started coming to him,  
and he sat down and taught them.  
Then the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman  
who had been caught in adultery  
and made her stand in the middle.  
They said to him,  
“Teacher, this woman was caught  
in the very act of committing adultery.  
Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women.  
So what do you say?”  
They said this to test him,  
so that they could have some charge to bring against him.  
Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground with his finger.  
But when they continued asking him,  
he straightened up and said to them,  
“Let the one among you who is without sin  
be the first to throw a stone at her.”  
Again he bent down and wrote on the ground.  
And in response, they went away one by one,  
beginning with the elders.  
So he was left alone with the woman before him.  
Then Jesus straightened up and said to her,  
“Woman, where are they?  
Has no one condemned you?”  
She replied, “No one, sir.”  
Then Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you.  
Go, and from now on do not sin any more.”
