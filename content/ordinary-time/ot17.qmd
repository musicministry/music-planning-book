#### First Reading [1 Kings 3:5, 7-12]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

The LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream at night.  
God said, "Ask something of me and I will give it to you."  
Solomon answered:  
"O LORD, my God, you have made me, your servant, king  
to succeed my father David;  
but I am a mere youth, not knowing at all how to act.  
I serve you in the midst of the people whom you have chosen,  
a people so vast that it cannot be numbered or counted.  
Give your servant, therefore, an understanding heart  
to judge your people and to distinguish right from wrong.  
For who is able to govern this vast people of yours?"  

The LORD was pleased that Solomon made this request.  
So God said to him:  
"Because you have asked for this—  
not for a long life for yourself,  
nor for riches,  
nor for the life of your enemies,  
but for understanding so that you may know what is right—  
I do as you requested.  
I give you a heart so wise and understanding  
that there has never been anyone like you up to now,  
and after you there will come no one to equal you."

:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Lord, I love your commands.**  

I have said, O LORD, that my part  
is to keep your words.  
The law of your mouth is to me more precious  
than thousands of gold and silver pieces. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Let your kindness comfort me  
according to your promise to your servants.  
Let your compassion come to me that I may live,  
for your law is my delight. **[℟.]{.red}**  

For I love your commands  
more than gold, however fine.  
For in all your precepts I go forward;  
every false way I hate. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Wonderful are your decrees;  
therefore I observe them.  
The revelation of your words sheds light,  
giving understanding to the simple. **[℟.]{.red}**

:::

Brothers and sisters:  
We know that all things work for good for those who love God,  
who are called according to his purpose.  
For those he foreknew he also predestined  
to be conformed to the image of his Son,  
so that he might be the firstborn  
among many brothers and sisters.  
And those he predestined he also called;  
and those he called he also justified;  
and those he justified he also glorified.

#### Gospel [Matthew 13:44-52 or 13:44-46]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus said to his disciples:  
"The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure buried in a field,  
which a person finds and hides again,  
and out of joy goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.  
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant  
searching for fine pearls.  
When he finds a pearl of great price,  
he goes and sells all that he has and buys it.  
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net thrown into the sea,  
which collects fish of every kind.  
When it is full they haul it ashore  
and sit down to put what is good into buckets.  
What is bad they throw away.  
Thus it will be at the end of the age.  
The angels will go out and separate the wicked from the righteous  
and throw them into the fiery furnace,  
where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.  

"Do you understand all these things?"  
They answered, "Yes."  
And he replied,  
"Then every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven  
is like the head of a household  
who brings from his storeroom both the new and the old."

#### First Reading [2 Kings 4:42-44]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

A man came from Baal-shalishah bringing to Elisha, the man of God,  
twenty barley loaves made from the firstfruits,  
and fresh grain in the ear.  
Elisha said, "Give it to the people to eat."  
But his servant objected,  
"How can I set this before a hundred people?"  
Elisha insisted, "Give it to the people to eat."  
"For thus says the LORD,  
'They shall eat and there shall be some left over.'"  
And when they had eaten, there was some left over,  
as the LORD had said.

**[℟.]{.red}** **The hand of the Lord feeds us; he answers all our needs.**  

Let all your works give you thanks, O LORD,  
and let your faithful ones bless you.  
Let them discourse of the glory of your kingdom  
and speak of your might. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The eyes of all look hopefully to you,  
and you give them their food in due season;  
you open your hand  
and satisfy the desire of every living thing. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The LORD is just in all his ways  
and holy in all his works.  
The LORD is near to all who call upon him,  
to all who call upon him in truth. **[℟.]{.red}**

Brothers and sisters:  
I, a prisoner for the Lord,  
urge you to live in a manner worthy of the call you have received,  
with all humility and gentleness, with patience,  
bearing with one another through love,  
striving to preserve the unity of the spirit through the bond of peace:  
one body and one Spirit,  
as you were also called to the one hope of your call;  
one Lord, one faith, one baptism;  
one God and Father of all,  
who is over all and through all and in all.

#### Gospel [John 6:1-15]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus went across the Sea of Galilee.  
A large crowd followed him,  
because they saw the signs he was performing on the sick.  
Jesus went up on the mountain,  
and there he sat down with his disciples.  
The Jewish feast of Passover was near.  
When Jesus raised his eyes  
and saw that a large crowd was coming to him,  
he said to Philip,  
"Where can we buy enough food for them to eat?"  
He said this to test him,  
because he himself knew what he was going to do.  
Philip answered him,  
"Two hundred days' wages worth of food would not be enough  
for each of them to have a little."  
One of his disciples,  
Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, said to him,  
"There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish;  
but what good are these for so many?"  
Jesus said, "Have the people recline."  
Now there was a great deal of grass in that place.  
So the men reclined, about five thousand in number.  
Then Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks,  
and distributed them to those who were reclining,  
and also as much of the fish as they wanted.  
When they had had their fill, he said to his disciples,  
"Gather the fragments left over,  
so that nothing will be wasted."  
So they collected them,  
and filled twelve wicker baskets with fragments  
from the five barley loaves  
that had been more than they could eat.  
When the people saw the sign he had done, they said,  
"This is truly the Prophet, the one who is to come into the world."  
Since Jesus knew that they were going to come and carry him off  
to make him king,  
he withdrew again to the mountain alone.

#### First Reading [Genesis 18:20-32]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

In those days, the LORD said: "The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great,  
and their sin so grave,  
that I must go down and see whether or not their actions  
fully correspond to the cry against them that comes to me.  
I mean to find out."  

While Abraham's visitors walked on farther toward Sodom,  
the LORD remained standing before Abraham.  
Then Abraham drew nearer and said:  
"Will you sweep away the innocent with the guilty?  
Suppose there were fifty innocent people in the city;  
would you wipe out the place, rather than spare it  
for the sake of the fifty innocent people within it?  
Far be it from you to do such a thing,  
to make the innocent die with the guilty  
so that the innocent and the guilty would be treated alike!  
Should not the judge of all the world act with justice?"  
The LORD replied,  
"If I find fifty innocent people in the city of Sodom,  
I will spare the whole place for their sake."  
Abraham spoke up again:  
"See how I am presuming to speak to my Lord,  
though I am but dust and ashes!  
What if there are five less than fifty innocent people?  
Will you destroy the whole city because of those five?"  
He answered, "I will not destroy it, if I find forty-five there."  
But Abraham persisted, saying "What if only forty are found there?"  
He replied, "I will forbear doing it for the sake of the forty."  
Then Abraham said, "Let not my Lord grow impatient if I go on.  
What if only thirty are found there?"  
He replied, "I will forbear doing it if I can find but thirty there."  
Still Abraham went on,  
"Since I have thus dared to speak to my Lord,  
what if there are no more than twenty?"  
The LORD answered, "I will not destroy it, for the sake of the twenty."  
But he still persisted:  
"Please, let not my Lord grow angry if I speak up this last time.  
What if there are at least ten there?"  
He replied, "For the sake of those ten, I will not destroy it."

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 138:1-2, 2-3, 6-7, 7-8]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Lord, on the day I called for help, you answered me.**  

I will give thanks to you, O LORD, with all my heart,  
for you have heard the words of my mouth;  
in the presence of the angels I will sing your praise;  
I will worship at your holy temple  
and give thanks to your name. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Because of your kindness and your truth;  
for you have made great above all things  
your name and your promise.  
When I called you answered me;  
you built up strength within me. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The LORD is exalted, yet the lowly he sees,  
and the proud he knows from afar.  
Though I walk amid distress, you preserve me;  
against the anger of my enemies you raise your hand. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Your right hand saves me.  
The LORD will complete what he has done for me;  
your kindness, O LORD, endures forever;  
forsake not the work of your hands. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Colossians 2:12-14]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
You were buried with him in baptism,  
in which you were also raised with him  
through faith in the power of God,  
who raised him from the dead.  
And even when you were dead  
in transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh,  
he brought you to life along with him,  
having forgiven us all our transgressions;  
 obliterating the bond against us, with its legal claims,  
which was opposed to us,  
he also removed it from our midst, nailing it to the cross.

#### Gospel [Luke 11:1-13]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus was praying in a certain place, and when he had finished,  
one of his disciples said to him,  
"Lord, teach us to pray just as John taught his disciples."  
He said to them, "When you pray, say:  
Father, hallowed be your name,  
your kingdom come.  
Give us each day our daily bread  
and forgive us our sins  
for we ourselves forgive everyone in debt to us,  
and do not subject us to the final test."  

And he said to them, "Suppose one of you has a friend  
to whom he goes at midnight and says,  
'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,  
for a friend of mine has arrived at my house from a journey  
and I have nothing to offer him,'  
and he says in reply from within,  
'Do not bother me; the door has already been locked  
and my children and I are already in bed.  
I cannot get up to give you anything.'  
I tell you,  
if he does not get up to give the visitor the loaves  
because of their friendship,  
he will get up to give him whatever he needs  
because of his persistence.  

"And I tell you, ask and you will receive;  
seek and you will find;  
knock and the door will be opened to you.  
For everyone who asks, receives;  
and the one who seeks, finds;  
and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.  
What father among you would hand his son a snake  
when he asks for a fish?  
Or hand him a scorpion when he asks for an egg?  
If you then, who are wicked,  
know how to give good gifts to your children,  
how much more will the Father in heaven  
give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?"
