#### First Reading [Ezekiel 34:11-12, 15-17]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Thus says the Lord GOD:  
I myself will look after and tend my sheep.  
As a shepherd tends his flock  
when he finds himself among his scattered sheep,  
so will I tend my sheep.  
I will rescue them from every place where they were scattered  
when it was cloudy and dark.  
I myself will pasture my sheep;  
I myself will give them rest, says the Lord GOD.  
The lost I will seek out,  
the strayed I will bring back,  
the injured I will bind up,  
the sick I will heal,  
but the sleek and the strong I will destroy,  
shepherding them rightly.  

As for you, my sheep, says the Lord GOD,  
I will judge between one sheep and another,  
between rams and goats.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 23:1-2, 2-3, 5-6]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.**  

The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.  
In verdant pastures he gives me repose. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Beside restful waters he leads me;  
he refreshes my soul.  
He guides me in right paths  
for his name's sake. **[℟.]{.red}**  

You spread the table before me  
in the sight of my foes;  
you anoint my head with oil;  
my cup overflows. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Only goodness and kindness follow me  
all the days of my life;  
and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD  
for years to come. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [1 Corinthians 15:20-26, 28]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
Christ has been raised from the dead,  
the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.  
For since death came through man,  
the resurrection of the dead came also through man.  
For just as in Adam all die,  
so too in Christ shall all be brought to life,  
but each one in proper order:  
Christ the firstfruits;  
then, at his coming, those who belong to Christ;  
then comes the end,  
when he hands over the kingdom to his God and Father,  
when he has destroyed every sovereignty  
and every authority and power.  
For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.  
The last enemy to be destroyed is death.  
When everything is subjected to him,  
then the Son himself will also be subjected  
to the one who subjected everything to him,  
so that God may be all in all.

#### Gospel [Matthew 25:31-46]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus said to his disciples:  
"When the Son of Man comes in his glory,  
and all the angels with him,  
he will sit upon his glorious throne,  
and all the nations will be assembled before him.  
And he will separate them one from another,  
as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.  
He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.  
Then the king will say to those on his right,  
'Come, you who are blessed by my Father.  
Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.  
For I was hungry and you gave me food,  
I was thirsty and you gave me drink,  
a stranger and you welcomed me,  
naked and you clothed me,  
ill and you cared for me,  
in prison and you visited me.'  
Then the righteous will answer him and say,  
'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you,  
or thirsty and give you drink?  
When did we see you a stranger and welcome you,  
or naked and clothe you?  
When did we see you ill or in prison, and visit you?'  
And the king will say to them in reply,  
'Amen, I say to you, whatever you did  
for one of the least brothers of mine, you did for me.'  
Then he will say to those on his left,  
'Depart from me, you accursed,  
into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.  
For I was hungry and you gave me no food,  
I was thirsty and you gave me no drink,  
a stranger and you gave me no welcome,  
naked and you gave me no clothing,  
ill and in prison, and you did not care for me.'  
Then they will answer and say,  
'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty  
or a stranger or naked or ill or in prison,  
and not minister to your needs?'  
He will answer them, 'Amen, I say to you,  
what you did not do for one of these least ones,  
you did not do for me.'  
And these will go off to eternal punishment,  
but the righteous to eternal life."

### &nbsp; Year B

#### First Reading [Daniel 7:13-14]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

As the visions during the night continued, I saw  
&emsp; one like a Son of man coming,  
&emsp; &emsp; on the clouds of heaven;  
&emsp; when he reached the Ancient One  
&emsp; &emsp; and was presented before him,  
&emsp; the one like a Son of man received dominion, glory, and kingship;  
&emsp; &emsp; all peoples, nations, and languages serve him.  
&emsp; His dominion is an everlasting dominion  
&emsp; &emsp; that shall not be taken away,  
&emsp; &emsp; his kingship shall not be destroyed.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 93:1, 1-2, 5]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **The Lord is king; he is robed in majesty.**  

The LORD is king, in splendor robed;  
&emsp; robed is the LORD and girt about with strength. **[℟.]{.red}**  

And he has made the world firm,  
&emsp; not to be moved.  
Your throne stands firm from of old;  
&emsp; from everlasting you are, O LORD. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Your decrees are worthy of trust indeed;  
&emsp; holiness befits your house,  
&emsp; O LORD, for length of days. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Revelation 1:5-8]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus Christ is the faithful witness,  
the firstborn of the dead and ruler of the kings of the earth.  
To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood,  
who has made us into a kingdom, priests for his God and Father,  
to him be glory and power forever and ever. Amen.  
Behold, he is coming amid the clouds,  
and every eye will see him,  
even those who pierced him.  
All the peoples of the earth will lament him.  
Yes. Amen.  

"I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God,  
"the one who is and who was and who is to come, the almighty."

#### Gospel [John 18:33b-37]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Pilate said to Jesus,  
"Are you the King of the Jews?"  
Jesus answered, "Do you say this on your own  
or have others told you about me?"  
Pilate answered, "I am not a Jew, am I?  
Your own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me.  
What have you done?"  
Jesus answered, "My kingdom does not belong to this world.  
If my kingdom did belong to this world,  
my attendants would be fighting  
to keep me from being handed over to the Jews.  
But as it is, my kingdom is not here."  
So Pilate said to him, "Then you are a king?"  
Jesus answered, "You say I am a king.  
For this I was born and for this I came into the world,  
to testify to the truth.  
Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice."

### &nbsp; Year C

#### First Reading [2 Samuel 5:1-3]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

In those days, all the tribes of Israel came to David in Hebron and said:  
"Here we are, your bone and your flesh.  
In days past, when Saul was our king,  
it was you who led the Israelites out and brought them back.  
And the LORD said to you,  
'You shall shepherd my people Israel  
and shall be commander of Israel.'"  
When all the elders of Israel came to David in Hebron,  
King David made an agreement with them there before the LORD,  
and they anointed him king of Israel.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 122:1-2, 3-4, 4-5]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Let us go rejoicing to the house of the Lord.**  

I rejoiced because they said to me,  
"We will go up to the house of the LORD."  
And now we have set foot  
within your gates, O Jerusalem. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Jerusalem, built as a city  
with compact unity.  
To it the tribes go up,  
the tribes of the LORD. **[℟.]{.red}**  

According to the decree for Israel,  
to give thanks to the name of the LORD.  
In it are set up judgment seats,  
seats for the house of David. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Colossians 1:12-20]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
Let us give thanks to the Father,  
who has made you fit to share  
in the inheritance of the holy ones in light.  
He delivered us from the power of darkness  
and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son,  
in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.  

He is the image of the invisible God,  
the firstborn of all creation.  
For in him were created all things in heaven and on earth,  
the visible and the invisible,  
whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers;  
all things were created through him and for him.  
He is before all things,  
and in him all things hold together.  
He is the head of the body, the church.  
He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead,  
that in all things he himself might be preeminent.  
For in him all the fullness was pleased to dwell,  
and through him to reconcile all things for him,  
making peace by the blood of his cross  
through him, whether those on earth or those in heaven.

#### Gospel [Luke 23:35-43]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

The rulers sneered at Jesus and said,  
"He saved others, let him save himself  
if he is the chosen one, the Christ of God."  
Even the soldiers jeered at him.  
As they approached to offer him wine they called out,  
"If you are King of the Jews, save yourself."  
Above him there was an inscription that read,  
"This is the King of the Jews."  

Now one of the criminals hanging there reviled Jesus, saying,  
"Are you not the Christ?  
Save yourself and us."  
The other, however, rebuking him, said in reply,  
"Have you no fear of God,  
for you are subject to the same condemnation?  
And indeed, we have been condemned justly,  
for the sentence we received corresponds to our crimes,  
but this man has done nothing criminal."  
Then he said,  
"Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."  
He replied to him,  
"Amen, I say to you,  
today you will be with me in Paradise."

### Notes
:::

* These hymns are used if the Solemnity of Christ the King occurs the
weekend before Thanksgiving Day in the United States. Otherwise, the
hymns for [Christ the King: After Thanksgiving Day](christ-the-king-after-thanksgiving.qmd) are used instead.
* The two Communion hymns – Hail, Redeemer, King Divine and
Come, Ye Thankful People, Come – are the same tune. Joining
these together with a brief organ interlude rather than a full stop will transition from Christ the King to a secondary theme of Thanksgiving, which will be celebrated on the upcoming Thursday.
