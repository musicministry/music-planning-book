And now, bless the God of all,  
&emsp; who has done wondrous things on earth;  
Who fosters people’s growth from their mother’s womb,  
&emsp; and fashions them according to his will!  
May he grant you joy of heart  
&emsp; and may peace abide among you;  
May his goodness toward us endure in Israel

**[℟.]{.red}** **I will praise your name for ever, Lord.**  

Every day will I bless you,  
&emsp; and I will praise your name forever and ever.  
Great is the LORD and highly to be praised;  
&emsp; his greatness is unsearchable. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Generation after generation praises your works  
&emsp; and proclaims your might.  
They speak of the splendor of your glorious majesty  
&emsp; and tell of your wondrous works. **[℟.]{.red}**  

They discourse of the power of your terrible deeds  
&emsp; and declare your greatness.  
They publish the fame of your abundant goodness  
&emsp; and joyfully sing of your justice. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The LORD is gracious and merciful,  
&emsp; slow to anger and of great kindness.  
The LORD is good to all  
&emsp; and compassionate toward all his works. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Let all your works give you thanks, O LORD,  
&emsp; and let your faithful ones bless you.  
Let them discourse of the glory of your Kingdom  
&emsp; and speak of your might. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [1 Corinthians 1:3-9]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
Grace to you and peace from God our Father  
and the Lord Jesus Christ.  

I give thanks to my God always on your account  
for the grace of God bestowed on you in Christ Jesus,  
that in him you were enriched in every way,  
with all discourse and all knowledge,  
as the testimony to Christ was confirmed among you,  
so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift  
as you wait for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
He will keep you firm to the end,  
irreproachable on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
God is faithful,  
and by him you were called to fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

#### Gospel [Luke 17:11-19]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

As Jesus continued his journey to Jerusalem,  
he traveled through Samaria and Galilee.  
As he was entering a village, ten persons with leprosy met him.  
They stood at a distance from him and raised their voices, saying,  
“Jesus, Master! Have pity on us!”  
And when he saw them, he said,  
“Go show yourselves to the priests.”  
As they were going they were cleansed.  
And one of them, realizing he had been healed,  
returned, glorifying God in a loud voice;  
and he fell at the feet of Jesus and thanked him.  
He was a Samaritan.  
Jesus said in reply,  
“Ten were cleansed, were they not?  
Where are the other nine?  
Has none but this foreigner returned to give thanks to God?”  
Then he said to him, “Stand up and go;  
your faith has saved you.”
