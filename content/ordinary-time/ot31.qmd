#### First Reading [Deuteronomy 6:2-6]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Moses spoke to the people, saying:  
"Fear the LORD, your God,  
and keep, throughout the days of your lives,  
all his statutes and commandments which I enjoin on you,  
and thus have long life.  
Hear then, Israel, and be careful to observe them,  
that you may grow and prosper the more,  
in keeping with the promise of the LORD, the God of your fathers,  
to give you a land flowing with milk and honey.  

"Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD alone!  
Therefore, you shall love the LORD, your God,  
with all your heart,  
and with all your soul,  
and with all your strength.  
Take to heart these words which I enjoin on you today."

**[℟.]{.red}** **I love you, Lord, my strength.**  

I love you, O LORD, my strength,  
&emsp; O LORD, my rock, my fortress, my deliverer. **[℟.]{.red}**  

My God, my rock of refuge,  
&emsp; my shield, the horn of my salvation, my stronghold!  
Praised be the LORD, I exclaim,  
&emsp; and I am safe from my enemies. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The LORD lives! And blessed be my rock!  
&emsp; Extolled be God my savior.  
You who gave great victories to your king  
&emsp; and showed kindness to your anointed. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Hebrews 7:23-28]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
The levitical priests were many  
because they were prevented by death from remaining in office,  
but Jesus, because he remains forever,  
has a priesthood that does not pass away.  
Therefore, he is always able to save those who approach God through him,  
since he lives forever to make intercession for them.  

It was fitting that we should have such a high priest:  
holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners,  
higher than the heavens.  
He has no need, as did the high priests,  
to offer sacrifice day after day,  
first for his own sins and then for those of the people;  
he did that once for all when he offered himself.  
For the law appoints men subject to weakness to be high priests,  
but the word of the oath, which was taken after the law,  
appoints a son,  
who has been made perfect forever.

#### Gospel Acclamation [John 14:23]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia, alleluia.**  
Whoever loves me will keep my word, says the Lord;  
and my father will love him and we will come to him. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Gospel [Mark 12:28b-34]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

One of the scribes came to Jesus and asked him,  
"Which is the first of all the commandments?"  
Jesus replied, "The first is this:  
*Hear, O Israel!*  
*The Lord our God is Lord alone!*  
*You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart,*  
*with all your soul,*  
*with all your mind,*  
*and with all your strength.*  
The second is this:  
*You shall love your neighbor as yourself.*  
There is no other commandment greater than these."  
The scribe said to him, "Well said, teacher.  
You are right in saying,  
'He is One and there is no other than he.'  
And 'to love him with all your heart,  
with all your understanding,  
with all your strength,  
and to love your neighbor as yourself'  
is worth more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices."  
And when Jesus saw that he answered with understanding,  
he said to him,  
"You are not far from the kingdom of God."  
And no one dared to ask him any more questions.

### &nbsp; Year C

#### First Reading [Wisdom 11:22-12:2]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Before the LORD the whole universe is as a grain from a balance  
or a drop of morning dew come down upon the earth.  
But you have mercy on all, because you can do all things;  
and you overlook people's sins that they may repent.  
For you love all things that are  
and loathe nothing that you have made;  
for what you hated, you would not have fashioned.  
And how could a thing remain, unless you willed it;  
or be preserved, had it not been called forth by you?  
But you spare all things, because they are yours,  
O LORD and lover of souls,  
for your imperishable spirit is in all things!  
Therefore you rebuke offenders little by little,  
warn them and remind them of the sins they are committing,  
that they may abandon their wickedness and believe in you, O LORD!

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 145:1-2, 8-9, 10-11, 13, 14]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **I will praise your name for ever, my king and my God.**  

I will extol you, O my God and King,  
and I will bless your name forever and ever.  
Every day will I bless you,  
and I will praise your name forever and ever. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The LORD is gracious and merciful,  
slow to anger and of great kindness.  
The LORD is good to all  
and compassionate toward all his works. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Let all your works give you thanks, O LORD,  
and let your faithful ones bless you.  
Let them discourse of the glory of your kingdom  
and speak of your might. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The LORD is faithful in all his words  
and holy in all his works.  
The LORD lifts up all who are falling.  
and raises up all who are bowed down. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [2 Thessalonians 1:11-2:2]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
We always pray for you,  
that our God may make you worthy of his calling  
and powerfully bring to fulfillment every good purpose  
and every effort of faith,  
that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you,  
and you in him,  
in accord with the grace of our God and Lord Jesus Christ.  

We ask you, brothers and sisters,  
with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ  
and our assembling with him,  
not to be shaken out of your minds suddenly, or to be alarmed  
either by a "spirit," or by an oral statement,  
or by a letter allegedly from us  
to the effect that the day of the Lord is at hand.

#### Gospel Acclamation [John 3:16]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia, alleluia.**  
God so loved the world that he gave his only Son,  
so that everyone who believes in him might have eternal life. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Gospel [Luke 19:1-10]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

At that time, Jesus came to Jericho and intended to pass through the town.  
Now a man there named Zacchaeus,  
who was a chief tax collector and also a wealthy man,  
was seeking to see who Jesus was;  
but he could not see him because of the crowd,  
for he was short in stature.  
So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree in order to see Jesus,  
who was about to pass that way.  
When he reached the place, Jesus looked up and said,  
"Zacchaeus, come down quickly,  
for today I must stay at your house."  
And he came down quickly and received him with joy.  
When they all saw this, they began to grumble, saying,  
"He has gone to stay at the house of a sinner."  
But Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord,  
"Behold, half of my possessions, Lord, I shall give to the poor,  
and if I have extorted anything from anyone  
I shall repay it four times over."  
And Jesus said to him,  
"Today salvation has come to this house  
because this man too is a descendant of Abraham.  
For the Son of Man has come to seek  
and to save what was lost."
