#### First Reading [Isaiah 5:1-7]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Let me now sing of my friend,  
my friend's song concerning his vineyard.  
My friend had a vineyard  
on a fertile hillside;  
he spaded it, cleared it of stones,  
and planted the choicest vines;  
within it he built a watchtower,  
and hewed out a wine press.  
Then he looked for the crop of grapes,  
but what it yielded was wild grapes.  

Now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and people of Judah,  
judge between me and my vineyard:  
What more was there to do for my vineyard  
that I had not done?  
Why, when I looked for the crop of grapes,  
did it bring forth wild grapes?  
Now, I will let you know  
what I mean to do with my vineyard:  
take away its hedge, give it to grazing,  
break through its wall, let it be trampled!  
Yes, I will make it a ruin:  
it shall not be pruned or hoed,  
but overgrown with thorns and briers;  
I will command the clouds  
not to send rain upon it.  
The vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel,  
and the people of Judah are his cherished plant;  
he looked for judgment, but see, bloodshed!  
for justice, but hark, the outcry!

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 80:9, 12, 13-14, 15-16, 19-20; Isaiah 5:7a]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **The vineyard of the Lord is the house of Israel.**  

A vine from Egypt you transplanted;  
you drove away the nations and planted it.  
It put forth its foliage to the Sea,  
its shoots as far as the River. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Why have you broken down its walls,  
so that every passer-by plucks its fruit,  
The boar from the forest lays it waste,  
and the beasts of the field feed upon it? **[℟.]{.red}**  

Once again, O LORD of hosts,  
look down from heaven, and see;  
take care of this vine,  
and protect what your right hand has planted,  
the son of man whom you yourself made strong. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Then we will no more withdraw from you;  
give us new life, and we will call upon your name.  
O LORD, God of hosts, restore us;  
if your face shine upon us, then we shall be saved. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Philippians 4:6-9]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
Have no anxiety at all, but in everything,  
by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving,  
make your requests known to God.  
Then the peace of God that surpasses all understanding  
will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.  

Finally, brothers and sisters,  
whatever is true, whatever is honorable,  
whatever is just, whatever is pure,  
whatever is lovely, whatever is gracious,  
if there is any excellence  
and if there is anything worthy of praise,  
think about these things.  
Keep on doing what you have learned and received  
and heard and seen in me.  
Then the God of peace will be with you.

#### Gospel [Matthew 21:33-43]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus said to the chief priests and the elders of the people:  
"Hear another parable.  
There was a landowner who planted a vineyard,  
put a hedge around it, dug a wine press in it, and built a tower.  
Then he leased it to tenants and went on a journey.  
When vintage time drew near,  
he sent his servants to the tenants to obtain his produce.  
But the tenants seized the servants and one they beat,  
another they killed, and a third they stoned.  
Again he sent other servants, more numerous than the first ones,  
but they treated them in the same way.  
Finally, he sent his son to them, thinking,  
'They will respect my son.'  
But when the tenants saw the son, they said to one another,  
'This is the heir.  
Come, let us kill him and acquire his inheritance.'  
They seized him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.  
What will the owner of the vineyard do to those tenants when he comes?"  
They answered him,  
"He will put those wretched men to a wretched death  
and lease his vineyard to other tenants  
who will give him the produce at the proper times."  
Jesus said to them, "Did you never read in the Scriptures:  
*The stone that the builders rejected*  
*has become the cornerstone;*  
*by the Lord has this been done,*  
*and it is wonderful in our eyes?*  
Therefore, I say to you,  
the kingdom of God will be taken away from you  
and given to a people that will produce its fruit."

### &nbsp; Year B

#### First Reading [Genesis 2:18-24]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

The LORD God said: "It is not good for the man to be alone.  
I will make a suitable partner for him."  
So the LORD God formed out of the ground  
various wild animals and various birds of the air,  
and he brought them to the man to see what he would call them;  
whatever the man called each of them would be its name.  
The man gave names to all the cattle,  
all the birds of the air, and all wild animals;  
but none proved to be the suitable partner for the man.  

So the LORD God cast a deep sleep on the man,  
and while he was asleep,  
he took out one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.  
The LORD God then built up into a woman the rib  
that he had taken from the man.  
When he brought her to the man, the man said:  
&emsp; "This one, at last, is bone of my bones  
&emsp; &emsp; and flesh of my flesh;  
&emsp; this one shall be called 'woman,'  
&emsp; &emsp; for out of 'her man’ this one has been taken."  
That is why a man leaves his father and mother  
and clings to his wife,  
and the two of them become one flesh.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 128:1-2, 3, 4-5, 6]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **May the Lord bless us all the days of our lives.**  

Blessed are you who fear the LORD,  
&emsp; who walk in his ways!  
For you shall eat the fruit of your handiwork;  
&emsp; blessed shall you be, and favored. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine  
&emsp; in the recesses of your home;  
your children like olive plants  
&emsp; around your table. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Behold, thus is the man blessed  
&emsp; who fears the LORD.  
The LORD bless you from Zion:  
&emsp; may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem.  
&emsp; all the days of your life. **[℟.]{.red}**  

May you see your children's children.  
&emsp; Peace be upon Israel! **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Hebrews 2:9-11]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
He "for a little while" was made "lower than the angels,"  
that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.  

For it was fitting that he,  
for whom and through whom all things exist,  
in bringing many children to glory,  
should make the leader to their salvation perfect through suffering.  
He who consecrates and those who are being consecrated  
all have one origin.  
Therefore, he is not ashamed to call them “brothers.”

#### Gospel [Mk 10:2-16 or 10:2-12]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

The Pharisees approached Jesus and asked,  
"Is it lawful for a husband to divorce his wife?"  
They were testing him.  
He said to them in reply, "What did Moses command you?"  
They replied,  
"Moses permitted a husband to write a bill of divorce  
and dismiss her."  
But Jesus told them,  
"Because of the hardness of your hearts  
he wrote you this commandment.  
But from the beginning of creation,  
*God made them male and female.*  
*For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother*  
*and be joined to his wife,*  
*and the two shall become one flesh.*  
So they are no longer two but one flesh.  
Therefore what God has joined together,  
no human being must separate."  
In the house the disciples again questioned Jesus about this.  
He said to them,  
"Whoever divorces his wife and marries another  
commits adultery against her;  
and if she divorces her husband and marries another,  
she commits adultery."  

And people were bringing children to him that he might touch them,  
but the disciples rebuked them.  
When Jesus saw this he became indignant and said to them,  
"Let the children come to me;  
do not prevent them, for the kingdom of God belongs to
such as these.  
Amen, I say to you,  
whoever does not accept the kingdom of God like a child
will not enter it."  
Then he embraced them and blessed them,  
placing his hands on them.

### &nbsp; Year C

#### First Reading [Habakkuk 1:2-3; 2:2-4]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

How long, O LORD?  I cry for help  
but you do not listen!  
I cry out to you, "Violence!"  
but you do not intervene.  
Why do you let me see ruin;  
why must I look at misery?  
Destruction and violence are before me;  
there is strife, and clamorous discord.  
Then the LORD answered me and said:  
Write down the vision clearly upon the tablets,  
so that one can read it readily.  
For the vision still has its time,  
presses on to fulfillment, and will not disappoint;  
if it delays, wait for it,  
it will surely come, it will not be late.  
The rash one has no integrity;  
but the just one, because of his faith, shall live.

**[℟.]{.red}** **If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts.**  

Come, let us sing joyfully to the LORD;  
let us acclaim the Rock of our salvation.  
Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving;  
let us joyfully sing psalms to him. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Come, let us bow down in worship;  
let us kneel before the LORD who made us.  
For he is our God,  
and we are the people he shepherds, the flock he guides. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Oh, that today you would hear his voice:  
"Harden not your hearts as at Meribah,  
as in the day of Massah in the desert,  
Where your fathers tempted me;  
they tested me though they had seen my works." **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [2 Timothy 1:6-8, 13-14]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Beloved:  
I remind you, to stir into flame  
the gift of God that you have through the imposition of my hands.  
For God did not give us a spirit of cowardice  
but rather of power and love and self-control.  
So do not be ashamed of your testimony to our Lord,  
nor of me, a prisoner for his sake;  
but bear your share of hardship for the gospel  
with the strength that comes from God.  

Take as your norm the sound words that you heard from me,  
in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.  
Guard this rich trust with the help of the Holy Spirit  
that dwells within us.

#### Gospel [Luke 17:5-10]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith."  
The Lord replied,  
"If you have faith the size of a mustard seed,  
you would say to this mulberry tree,  
'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it would obey you.  

"Who among you would say to your servant  
who has just come in from plowing or tending sheep in the field,  
'Come here immediately and take your place at table'?  
Would he not rather say to him,  
'Prepare something for me to eat.  
Put on your apron and wait on me while I eat and drink.  
You may eat and drink when I am finished'?  
Is he grateful to that servant because he did what was commanded?  
So should it be with you.  
When you have done all you have been commanded,  
say, 'We are unprofitable servants;  
we have done what we were obliged to do.'"
