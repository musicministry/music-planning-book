#### First Reading [Wisdom 6:12-16]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Resplendent and unfading is wisdom,  
and she is readily perceived by those who love her,  
and found by those who seek her.  
She hastens to make herself known in anticipation of their desire;  
Whoever watches for her at dawn shall not be disappointed,  
for he shall find her sitting by his gate.  
For taking thought of wisdom is the perfection of prudence,  
and whoever for her sake keeps vigil  
shall quickly be free from care;  
because she makes her own rounds, seeking those worthy of her,  
and graciously appears to them in the ways,  
and meets them with all solicitude.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 63:2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **My soul is thirsting for you, O Lord my God.**  

O God, you are my God whom I seek;  
for you my flesh pines and my soul thirsts. 
like the earth, parched, lifeless and without water. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Thus have I gazed toward you in the sanctuary  
to see your power and your glory,  
For your kindness is a greater good than life;  
my lips shall glorify you. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Thus will I bless you while I live;  
lifting up my hands, I will call upon your name.  
As with the riches of a banquet shall my soul be satisfied,  
and with exultant lips my mouth shall praise you. **[℟.]{.red}**  

I will remember you upon my couch,  
and through the night-watches I will meditate on you:  
You are my help,  
and in the shadow of your wings I shout for joy. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 or 4:13-14]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

We do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters,  
about those who have fallen asleep,  
so that you may not grieve like the rest, who have no hope.  
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose,  
so too will God, through Jesus,  
bring with him those who have fallen asleep.  
Indeed, we tell you this, on the word of the Lord,  
that we who are alive,  
who are left until the coming of the Lord,  
will surely not precede those who have fallen asleep.  
For the Lord himself, with a word of command,  
with the voice of an archangel and with the trumpet of God,  
will come down from heaven,  
and the dead in Christ will rise first.  
Then we who are alive, who are left,  
will be caught up together with them in the clouds  
to meet the Lord in the air.   
Thus we shall always be with the Lord.  
Therefore, console one another with these words.

#### Gospel [Matthew 25:1-13]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus told his disciples this parable:  
"The kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins  
who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.  
Five of them were foolish and five were wise.  
The foolish ones, when taking their lamps,  
brought no oil with them,  
but the wise brought flasks of oil with their lamps.  
Since the bridegroom was long delayed,  
they all became drowsy and fell asleep.  
At midnight, there was a cry,  
'Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!'  
Then all those virgins got up and trimmed their lamps.  
The foolish ones said to the wise,  
'Give us some of your oil,  
for our lamps are going out.'  
But the wise ones replied,  
'No, for there may not be enough for us and you.  
Go instead to the merchants and buy some for yourselves.'  
While they went off to buy it,  
the bridegroom came  
and those who were ready went into the wedding feast with him.  
Then the door was locked.  
Afterwards the other virgins came and said,  
'Lord, Lord, open the door for us!'  
But he said in reply,  
'Amen, I say to you, I do not know you.'  
Therefore, stay awake,  
for you know neither the day nor the hour."

#### First Reading [1 Kings 17:10-16]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

In those days, Elijah the prophet went to Zarephath.  
As he arrived at the entrance of the city,  
a widow was gathering sticks there; he called out to her,  
"Please bring me a small cupful of water to drink."  
She left to get it, and he called out after her,  
"Please bring along a bit of bread."  
She answered, "As the LORD, your God, lives,  
I have nothing baked; there is only a handful of flour in my jar  
and a little oil in my jug.  
Just now I was collecting a couple of sticks,  
to go in and prepare something for myself and my son;  
when we have eaten it, we shall die."   
Elijah said to her, "Do not be afraid.  
Go and do as you propose.  
But first make me a little cake and bring it to me.  
Then you can prepare something for yourself and your son.  
For the LORD, the God of Israel, says,  
'The jar of flour shall not go empty,  
nor the jug of oil run dry,  
until the day when the LORD sends rain upon the earth.'"  
She left and did as Elijah had said.  
She was able to eat for a year, and he and her son as well;  
the jar of flour did not go empty,  
nor the jug of oil run dry,  
as the LORD had foretold through Elijah.

**[℟.]{.red}** **Praise the Lord, my soul!**  
[Or:]{.red}  
**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia.**  

The LORD keeps faith forever,  
secures justice for the oppressed,  
gives food to the hungry.  
The LORD sets captives free. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The LORD gives sight to the blind.  
The LORD raises up those who were bowed down;  
the LORD loves the just.  
The LORD protects strangers. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The fatherless and the widow he sustains,  
but the way of the wicked he thwarts.  
The LORD shall reign forever;  
your God, O Zion, through all generations. Alleluia. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Hebrews 9:24-28]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Christ did not enter into a sanctuary made by hands,  
a copy of the true one, but heaven itself,  
that he might now appear before God on our behalf.  
Not that he might offer himself repeatedly,  
as the high priest enters each year into the sanctuary  
with blood that is not his own;  
if that were so, he would have had to suffer repeatedly  
from the foundation of the world.  
But now once for all he has appeared at the end of the ages  
to take away sin by his sacrifice.  
Just as it is appointed that human beings die once,  
and after this the judgment, so also Christ,  
offered once to take away the sins of many,  
will appear a second time, not to take away sin  
but to bring salvation to those who eagerly await him.

#### Gospel [Mark 12:38-44 or 12:41-44]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

In the course of his teaching Jesus said to the crowds,  
"Beware of the scribes, who like to go around in long robes  
and accept greetings in the marketplaces,  
seats of honor in synagogues,   
and places of honor at banquets.  
They devour the houses of widows and, as a pretext  
recite lengthy prayers.  
They will receive a very severe condemnation."  

He sat down opposite the treasury  
and observed how the crowd put money into the treasury.  
Many rich people put in large sums.  
A poor widow also came and put in two small coins worth a few cents.  
Calling his disciples to himself, he said to them,  
"Amen, I say to you, this poor widow put in more  
than all the other contributors to the treasury.  
For they have all contributed from their surplus wealth,  
but she, from her poverty, has contributed all she had,  
her whole livelihood."

#### First Reading [2 Maccabees 7:1-2, 9-14]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

It happened that seven brothers with their mother were arrested  
and tortured with whips and scourges by the king,  
to force them to eat pork in violation of God's law.  
One of the brothers, speaking for the others, said:  
"What do you expect to achieve by questioning us?  
We are ready to die rather than transgress the laws of our ancestors."  

At the point of death he said:  
"You accursed fiend, you are depriving us of this present life,  
but the King of the world will raise us up to live again forever.  
It is for his laws that we are dying."  

After him the third suffered their cruel sport.  
He put out his tongue at once when told to do so,  
and bravely held out his hands, as he spoke these noble words:  
"It was from Heaven that I received these;  
for the sake of his laws I disdain them;  
from him I hope to receive them again."  
Even the king and his attendants marveled at the young man's courage,  
because he regarded his sufferings as nothing.  

After he had died,  
they tortured and maltreated the fourth brother in the same way.  
When he was near death, he said,  
"It is my choice to die at the hands of men  
with the hope God gives of being raised up by him;  
but for you, there will be no resurrection to life."

:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Lord, when your glory appears, my joy will be full.**  

Hear, O LORD, a just suit;  
attend to my outcry;  
hearken to my prayer from lips without deceit. **[℟.]{.red}**  

My steps have been steadfast in your paths,  
my feet have not faltered.  
I call upon you, for you will answer me, O God;  
incline your ear to me; hear my word. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Keep me as the apple of your eye,  
hide me in the shadow of your wings.  
But I in justice shall behold your face;  
on waking I shall be content in your presence. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [2 Thessalonians 2:16-3:5]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father,  
who has loved us and given us everlasting encouragement  
and good hope through his grace,  
encourage your hearts and strengthen them in every good deed
and word.  

Finally, brothers and sisters, pray for us,  
so that the word of the Lord may speed forward and be glorified,  
as it did among you,  
and that we may be delivered from perverse and wicked people,  
for not all have faith.  
But the Lord is faithful;  
he will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one.  
We are confident of you in the Lord that what we instruct you,  
you are doing and will continue to do.  
May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God  
and to the endurance of Christ.

#### Gospel [Luke 20:27-38 or 20:27, 34-38]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Some Sadducees, those who deny that there is a resurrection,  
came forward and put this question to Jesus, saying,  
"Teacher, Moses wrote for us,  
If someone's brother dies leaving a wife but no child,  
his brother must take the wife  
and raise up descendants for his brother.  
Now there were seven brothers;  
the first married a woman but died childless.  
Then the second and the third married her,  
and likewise all the seven died childless.  
Finally the woman also died.  
Now at the resurrection whose wife will that woman be?  
For all seven had been married to her."  
Jesus said to them,  
"The children of this age marry and remarry;  
but those who are deemed worthy to attain to the coming age  
and to the resurrection of the dead  
neither marry nor are given in marriage.  
They can no longer die,  
for they are like angels;  
and they are the children of God  
because they are the ones who will rise.  
That the dead will rise  
even Moses made known in the passage about the bush,  
when he called out 'Lord,'  
the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob;  
and he is not God of the dead, but of the living,  
for to him all are alive."
