### &nbsp; Year A

#### First Reading [Sirach 15:15-20]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

If you choose you can keep the commandments, they will save you;  
if you trust in God, you too shall live;  
he has set before you fire and water  
to whichever you choose, stretch forth your hand.  
Before man are life and death, good and evil,  
whichever he chooses shall be given him.  
Immense is the wisdom of the Lord;  
he is mighty in power, and all-seeing.  
The eyes of God are on those who fear him;  
he understands man's every deed.  
No one does he command to act unjustly,  
to none does he give license to sin.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 119:1-2, 4-5, 17-18, 33-34]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Blessed are they who follow the law of the Lord!**  

Blessed are they whose way is blameless,  
who walk in the law of the LORD.  
Blessed are they who observe his decrees,  
who seek him with all their heart. **[℟.]{.red}**  

You have commanded that your precepts  
be diligently kept.  
Oh, that I might be firm in the ways  
of keeping your statutes! **[℟.]{.red}**  

Be good to your servant, that I may live  
and keep your words.  
Open my eyes, that I may consider  
the wonders of your law. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Instruct me, O LORD, in the way of your statutes,  
that I may exactly observe them.  
Give me discernment, that I may observe your law  
and keep it with all my heart. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [1 Corinthians 2:6-10]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
We speak a wisdom to those who are mature,  
not a wisdom of this age,  
nor of the rulers of this age who are passing away.  
Rather, we speak God's wisdom, mysterious, hidden,  
which God predetermined before the ages for our glory,  
and which none of the rulers of this age knew;  
for, if they had known it,  
they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.  
But as it is written:  
*What eye has not seen, and ear has not heard,*  
*and what has not entered the human heart,*  
*what God has prepared for those who love him,*  
this God has revealed to us through the Spirit.

For the Spirit scrutinizes everything, even the depths of God.

you have revealed to little ones the mysteries of the kingdom. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Gospel [Matthew 5:17-37 or Matthew 5:20-22a, 27-28, 33-34a, 37]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus said to his disciples:  
"Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets.  
I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.  
Amen, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away,  
not the smallest letter or the smallest part of a letter  
will pass from the law,  
until all things have taken place.  
Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments  
and teaches others to do so  
will be called least in the kingdom of heaven.  
But whoever obeys and teaches these commandments  
will be called greatest in the kingdom of heaven.  
I tell you, unless your righteousness surpasses  
that of the scribes and Pharisees,  
you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.  

"You have heard that it was said to your ancestors,  
*You shall not kill; and whoever kills will be liable to judgment.*  
But I say to you,  
whoever is angry with his brother  
will be liable to judgment;  
and whoever says to his brother, 'Raqa,'  
will be answerable to the Sanhedrin;  
and whoever says, 'You fool,'  
will be liable to fiery Gehenna.  
Therefore, if you bring your gift to the altar,  
and there recall that your brother  
has anything against you,  
leave your gift there at the altar,  
go first and be reconciled with your brother,  
and then come and offer your gift.  
Settle with your opponent quickly while on the way to court.  
Otherwise your opponent will hand you over to the judge,  
and the judge will hand you over to the guard,  
and you will be thrown into prison.  
Amen, I say to you,  
you will not be released until you have paid the last penny.

"You have heard that it was said,  
*You shall not commit adultery.*  
But I say to you,  
everyone who looks at a woman with lust  
has already committed adultery with her in his heart.  
If your right eye causes you to sin,  
tear it out and throw it away.  
It is better for you to lose one of your members  
than to have your whole body thrown into Gehenna.  
And if your right hand causes you to sin,  
cut it off and throw it away.  
It is better for you to lose one of your members  
than to have your whole body go into Gehenna.

"It was also said,  
*Whoever divorces his wife must give her a bill of divorce.*  
But I say to you,  
whoever divorces his wife -  unless the marriage is unlawful -  
causes her to commit adultery,  
and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.  

"Again you have heard that it was said to your ancestors,  
*Do not take a false oath,*  
*but make good to the Lord all that you vow.*  
But I say to you, do not swear at all;  
not by heaven, for it is God's throne;  
nor by the earth, for it is his footstool;  
nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.  
Do not swear by your head,  
for you cannot make a single hair white or black.  
Let your 'Yes' mean 'Yes,' and your 'No' mean 'No.'  
Anything more is from the evil one."

### &nbsp; Year B

#### First Reading [Leviticus 13:1-2, 44-46]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,  
“If someone has on his skin a scab or pustule or blotch. 
which appears to be the sore of leprosy,  
he shall be brought to Aaron, the priest,  
or to one of the priests among his descendants.  
If the man is leprous and unclean,  
the priest shall declare him unclean  
by reason of the sore on his head.

“The one who bears the sore of leprosy  
shall keep his garments rent and his head bare,  
and shall muffle his beard;  
he shall cry out, ‘Unclean, unclean!’  
As long as the sore is on him he shall declare himself unclean,  
since he is in fact unclean.  
He shall dwell apart, making his abode outside the camp.”

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 32:1-2, 5, 11]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **I turn to you, Lord, in time of trouble, and you fill me with the joy of salvation.**  

Blessed is he whose fault is taken away,  
&emsp; whose sin is covered.  
Blessed the man to whom the LORD imputes not guilt,  
&emsp; in whose spirit there is no guile. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Then I acknowledged my sin to you,  
&emsp; my guilt I covered not.  
I said, “I confess my faults to the LORD,”  
&emsp; and you took away the guilt of my sin. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Be glad in the LORD and rejoice, you just;  
&emsp; exult, all you upright of heart. **[℟.]{.red}**  

***

::: {.red}
#### Second Reading [1 Corinthians 10:31—11:1]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters,  
Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do,  
do everything for the glory of God.  
Avoid giving offense, whether to the Jews or Greeks or  
the church of God,  
just as I try to please everyone in every way,  
not seeking my own benefit but that of the many,  
that they may be saved.  
Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.

#### Alleluia [Luke 7:16]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia, alleluia.**  
A great prophet has arisen in our midst,  
God has visited his people. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Gospel [Mark 1:40-45]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

A leper came to Jesus and kneeling down begged him and said,  
“If you wish, you can make me clean.”  
Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand,  
touched him, and said to him,  
“I do will it. Be made clean.”  
The leprosy left him immediately, and he was made clean.  
Then, warning him sternly, he dismissed him at once. 

He said to him, “See that you tell no one anything,  
but go, show yourself to the priest  
and offer for your cleansing what Moses prescribed;  
that will be proof for them.”

The man went away and began to publicize the whole matter.  
He spread the report abroad  
so that it was impossible for Jesus to enter a town openly.  
He remained outside in deserted places,  
and people kept coming to him from everywhere.

### &nbsp; Year C

#### First Reading [Jeremiah 17:5-8]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Thus says the LORD:  
&emsp; Cursed is the one who trusts in human beings,  
&emsp; &emsp; who seeks his strength in flesh,  
&emsp; &emsp; whose heart turns away from the LORD.  
&emsp; He is like a barren bush in the desert  
&emsp; &emsp; that enjoys no change of season,  
&emsp; but stands in a lava waste,  
&emsp; &emsp; a salt and empty earth.  
&emsp; Blessed is the one who trusts in the LORD,  
&emsp; &emsp; whose hope is the LORD.  
&emsp; He is like a tree planted beside the waters  
&emsp; &emsp; that stretches out its roots to the stream:  
&emsp; it fears not the heat when it comes;  
&emsp; &emsp; its leaves stay green;  
&emsp; in the year of drought it shows no distress,  
&emsp; &emsp; but still bears fruit.  

***

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 1:1-2, 3, 4, 6]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Blessed are they who hope in the Lord.**  

Blessed the man who follows not  
&emsp; the counsel of the wicked,  
nor walks in the way of sinners,  
&emsp; nor sits in the company of the insolent,  
but delights in the law of the LORD  
&emsp; and meditates on his law day and night. **[℟.]{.red}**  

He is like a tree  
&emsp; planted near running water,  
that yields its fruit in due season,  
&emsp; and whose leaves never fade.  
Whatever he does, prospers. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Not so the wicked, not so;  
&emsp; they are like chaff which the wind drives away.  
For the LORD watches over the way of the just,  
&emsp; but the way of the wicked vanishes. **[℟.]{.red}**  

***

::: {.red}
#### Second Reading [1 Corinthians 15:12, 16-20]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
If Christ is preached as raised from the dead,  
how can some among you say there is no resurrection of the dead?  
If the dead are not raised, neither has Christ been raised,  
and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain;  
you are still in your sins.  
Then those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.  
If for this life only we have hoped in Christ,  
we are the most pitiable people of all.  

But now Christ has been raised from the dead,  
the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.

#### Gospel [Luke 6:17, 20-26]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus came down with the Twelve  
and stood on a stretch of level ground  
with a great crowd of his disciples  
and a large number of the people  
from all Judea and Jerusalem  
and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon.  
And raising his eyes toward his disciples he said:  
&emsp; “Blessed are you who are poor,  
&emsp; &emsp; for the kingdom of God is yours.  
&emsp; Blessed are you who are now hungry,  
&emsp; &emsp; for you will be satisfied.  
&emsp; Blessed are you who are now weeping,  
&emsp; &emsp; for you will laugh.  
&emsp; Blessed are you when people hate you,  
&emsp; &emsp; and when they exclude and insult you,  
&emsp; &emsp; and denounce your name as evil  
&emsp; &emsp; on account of the Son of Man.  
Rejoice and leap for joy on that day!  
Behold, your reward will be great in heaven.  
For their ancestors treated the prophets in the same way.  
&emsp; But woe to you who are rich,  
&emsp; &emsp; for you have received your consolation.  
&emsp; Woe to you who are filled now,  
&emsp; &emsp; for you will be hungry.  
&emsp; Woe to you who laugh now,  
&emsp; &emsp; for you will grieve and weep.  
&emsp; Woe to you when all speak well of you,  
&emsp; &emsp; for their ancestors treated the false prophets in this way.”
