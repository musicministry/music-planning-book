### &nbsp; Year A

#### First Reading [Jeremiah 20:10-13]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jeremiah said:  
"I hear the whisperings of many:  
'Terror on every side!  
Denounce! let us denounce him!'  
All those who were my friends  
are on the watch for any misstep of mine.  
'Perhaps he will be trapped; then we can prevail,  
and take our vengeance on him.'  
But the LORD is with me, like a mighty champion:  
my persecutors will stumble, they will not triumph.  
In their failure they will be put to utter shame,  
to lasting, unforgettable confusion.  
O LORD of hosts, you who test the just,  
who probe mind and heart,  
let me witness the vengeance you take on them,  
for to you I have entrusted my cause.  
Sing to the LORD,  
praise the LORD,  
for he has rescued the life of the poor  
from the power of the wicked!"

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 69:8-10, 14, 17, 33-35]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Lord, in your great love, answer me.**  

For your sake I bear insult,  
and shame covers my face.  
I have become an outcast to my brothers,  
a stranger to my mother's children,  
Because zeal for your house consumes me,  
and the insults of those who blaspheme you fall upon me. **[℟.]{.red}**  

I pray to you, O LORD,  
for the time of your favor, O God!  
In your great kindness answer me  
with your constant help.  
Answer me, O LORD, for bounteous is your kindness;  
in your great mercy turn toward me. **[℟.]{.red}**  

"See, you lowly ones, and be glad;  
you who seek God, may your hearts revive!  
For the LORD hears the poor,  
and his own who are in bonds he spurns not.  
Let the heavens and the earth praise him,  
the seas and whatever moves in them!" **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Romans 5:12-15]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
Through one man sin entered the world,  
and through sin, death,  
and thus death came to all men, inasmuch as all sinned—  
for up to the time of the law, sin was in the world,  
though sin is not accounted when there is no law.  
But death reigned from Adam to Moses,  
even over those who did not sin  
after the pattern of the trespass of Adam,  
who is the type of the one who was to come.  

But the gift is not like the transgression.  
For if by the transgression of the one the many died,  
how much more did the grace of God  
and the gracious gift of the one man Jesus Christ  
overflow for the many.

#### Gospel Acclamation [John 15:26b, 27a]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia, alleluia.**  
The Spirit of truth will testify to me, says the Lord;  
and you also will testify. **[℟.]{.red}**  

***

::: {.red}
#### Gospel [Matthew 10:26-33]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus said to the Twelve:  
"Fear no one.  
Nothing is concealed that will not be revealed,  
nor secret that will not be known.  
What I say to you in the darkness, speak in the light;  
what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops.  
And do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul;  
rather, be afraid of the one who can destroy  
both soul and body in Gehenna.  
Are not two sparrows sold for a small coin?  
Yet not one of them falls to the ground without your Father's knowledge.  
Even all the hairs of your head are counted.  
So do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.  
Everyone who acknowledges me before others  
I will acknowledge before my heavenly Father.  
But whoever denies me before others,  
I will deny before my heavenly Father."

### &nbsp; Year B

#### First Reading [Job 38:1, 8-11]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

The Lord addressed Job out of the storm and said:
&emsp; Who shut within doors the sea,
&emsp; &emsp; when it burst forth from the womb;
&emsp; when I made the clouds its garment
&emsp; &emsp; and thick darkness its swaddling bands?
&emsp; When I set limits for it
&emsp; &emsp; and fastened the bar of its door,
&emsp; and said: Thus far shall you come but no farther,
&emsp; &emsp; and here shall your proud waves be stilled!

***

::: {.red}
#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 107:23-24, 25-26, 28-29, 30-31]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Give thanks to the Lord, his love is everlasting.**  
[Or:]{.red}  
**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia.**

They who sailed the sea in ships,
&emsp; trading on the deep waters,
These saw the works of the LORD
&emsp; and his wonders in the abyss. **[℟.]{.red}**  

His command raised up a storm wind
&emsp; which tossed its waves on high.
They mounted up to heaven; they sank to the depths;
&emsp; their hearts melted away in their plight. **[℟.]{.red}**  

They cried to the LORD in their distress;
&emsp; from their straits he rescued them,
He hushed the storm to a gentle breeze,
&emsp; and the billows of the sea were stilled. **[℟.]{.red}**  

They rejoiced that they were calmed,
&emsp; and he brought them to their desired haven.
Let them give thanks to the LORD for his kindness
&emsp; and his wondrous deeds to the children of men. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [2 Corinthians 5:14-17]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
The love of Christ impels us,  
once we have come to the conviction that one died for all;  
therefore, all have died.  
He indeed died for all,  
so that those who live might no longer live for themselves  
but for him who for their sake died and was raised.  

Consequently, from now on we regard no one according to the flesh;  
even if we once knew Christ according to the flesh,  
yet now we know him so no longer.  
So whoever is in Christ is a new creation:  
the old things have passed away;  
behold, new things have come.

#### Gospel Acclamation [Luke 7:16]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia, alleluia.**  
A great prophet has risen in our midst  
God has visited his people. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Gospel [Mark 4:35-41]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

On that day, as evening drew on, Jesus said to his disciples:  
“Let us cross to the other side.”  
Leaving the crowd, they took Jesus with them in the boat just as he was.  
And other boats were with him.  
A violent squall came up and waves were breaking over the boat,  
so that it was already filling up.  
Jesus was in the stern, asleep on a cushion.  
They woke him and said to him,  
“Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?”  
He woke up,  
rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Quiet!  Be still!”  
The wind ceased and there was great calm.  
Then he asked them, “Why are you terrified?  
Do you not yet have faith?”  
They were filled with great awe and said to one another,  
“Who then is this whom even wind and sea obey?”
