::: {.red}
#### First Reading [Exodus 22:20-26]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Thus says the LORD:  
"You shall not molest or oppress an alien,  
for you were once aliens yourselves in the land of Egypt.  
You shall not wrong any widow or orphan.  
If ever you wrong them and they cry out to me,  
I will surely hear their cry.  
My wrath will flare up, and I will kill you with the sword;  
then your own wives will be widows, and your children orphans.  

"If you lend money to one of your poor neighbors among my people,  
you shall not act like an extortioner toward him  
by demanding interest from him.  
If you take your neighbor's cloak as a pledge,  
you shall return it to him before sunset;  
for this cloak of his is the only covering he has for his body.  
What else has he to sleep in?  
If he cries out to me, I will hear him; for I am compassionate."

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 18:2-3, 3-4, 47, 51]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **I love you, Lord, my strength.**  

I love you, O LORD, my strength,  
O LORD, my rock, my fortress, my deliverer. **[℟.]{.red}**  

My God, my rock of refuge,  
my shield, the horn of my salvation, my stronghold!  
Praised be the LORD, I exclaim,  
and I am safe from my enemies. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The LORD lives and blessed be my rock!  
Extolled be God my savior.  
You who gave great victories to your king  
and showed kindness to your anointed. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [1 Thessalonians 1:5c-10]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
You know what sort of people we were among you for your sake.  
And you became imitators of us and of the Lord,  
receiving the word in great affliction, with joy from the Holy Spirit,  
so that you became a model for all the believers  
in Macedonia and in Achaia.  
For from you the word of the Lord has sounded forth  
not only in Macedonia and in Achaia,  
but in every place your faith in God has gone forth,  
so that we have no need to say anything.  
For they themselves openly declare about us  
what sort of reception we had among you,  
and how you turned to God from idols  
to serve the living and true God  
and to await his Son from heaven,  
whom he raised from the dead,  
Jesus, who delivers us from the coming wrath.

#### Gospel [Matthew 22:34-40]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees,  
they gathered together, and one of them,  
a scholar of the law tested him by asking,  
"Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?"  
He said to him,  
"You shall love the Lord, your God,  
with all your heart,  
with all your soul,  
and with all your mind.  
This is the greatest and the first commandment.  
The second is like it:  
You shall love your neighbor as yourself.  
The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments."

#### First Reading [Jeremiah 31:7-9]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Thus says the LORD:  
Shout with joy for Jacob,  
&emsp; exult at the head of the nations;  
&emsp; proclaim your praise and say:  
The LORD has delivered his people,  
&emsp; the remnant of Israel.  
Behold, I will bring them back  
&emsp; from the land of the north;  
I will gather them from the ends of the world,  
&emsp; with the blind and the lame in their midst,  
the mothers and those with child;  
&emsp; they shall return as an immense throng.  
They departed in tears,  
&emsp; but I will console them and guide them;  
I will lead them to brooks of water,  
&emsp; on a level road, so that none shall stumble.  
For I am a father to Israel,  
&emsp; Ephraim is my first-born.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 126:1-2, 2-3, 4-5, 6]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **The Lord has done great things for us; we are filled with joy.**  

When the LORD brought back the captives of Zion,  
&emsp; we were like men dreaming.  
Then our mouth was filled with laughter,  
&emsp; and our tongue with rejoicing. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Then they said among the nations,  
&emsp; "The LORD has done great things for them."  
The LORD has done great things for us;  
&emsp; we are glad indeed. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Restore our fortunes, O LORD,  
&emsp; like the torrents in the southern desert.  
Those that sow in tears  
&emsp; shall reap rejoicing. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Although they go forth weeping,  
&emsp; carrying the seed to be sown,  
They shall come back rejoicing,  
&emsp; carrying their sheaves. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Hebrews 5:1-6]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
Every high priest is taken from among men  
and made their representative before God,  
to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.  
He is able to deal patiently with the ignorant and erring,  
for he himself is beset by weakness  
and so, for this reason, must make sin offerings for himself  
as well as for the people.  
No one takes this honor upon himself  
but only when called by God,  
just as Aaron was.  
In the same way,  
it was not Christ who glorified himself in becoming high priest,  
but rather the one who said to him:  
&emsp; *You are my son:*  
&emsp; *this day I have begotten you;*  
just as he says in another place:  
&emsp; *You are a priest forever*  
&emsp; *according to the order of Melchizedek.*

#### Gospel [Mark 10:46-52]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

As Jesus was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a sizable crowd,  
Bartimaeus, a blind man, the son of Timaeus,  
sat by the roadside begging.  
On hearing that it was Jesus of Nazareth,  
he began to cry out and say,  
"Jesus, son of David, have pity on me."  
And many rebuked him, telling him to be silent.  
But he kept calling out all the more,  
"Son of David, have pity on me."  
Jesus stopped and said, "Call him."  
So they called the blind man, saying to him,  
"Take courage; get up, Jesus is calling you."  
He threw aside his cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus.  
Jesus said to him in reply, "What do you want me to do for you?"  
The blind man replied to him, "Master, I want to see."  
Jesus told him, "Go your way; your faith has saved you."  
Immediately he received his sight  
and followed him on the way.

### &nbsp; Year C

::: {.red}
#### First Reading [Sirach 35:12-14, 16-18]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

The LORD is a God of justice,  
who knows no favorites.  
Though not unduly partial toward the weak,  
yet he hears the cry of the oppressed.  
The Lord is not deaf to the wail of the orphan,  
nor to the widow when she pours out her complaint.  
The one who serves God willingly is heard;  
his petition reaches the heavens.  
The prayer of the lowly pierces the clouds;  
it does not rest till it reaches its goal,  
nor will it withdraw till the Most High responds,  
judges justly and affirms the right,  
and the Lord will not delay.  

***

::: {.red}
#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 34:2-3, 17-18, 19, 23]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **The Lord hears the cry of the poor.**  

I will bless the LORD at all times;  
his praise shall be ever in my mouth.  
Let my soul glory in the LORD;  
the lowly will hear me and be glad. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The LORD confronts the evildoers,  
to destroy remembrance of them from the earth.  
When the just cry out, the LORD hears them,  
and from all their distress he rescues them. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The LORD is close to the brokenhearted;  
and those who are crushed in spirit he saves.  
The LORD redeems the lives of his servants;  
no one incurs guilt who takes refuge in him. **[℟.]{.red}**  

***

#### Second Reading [2 Timothy 4:6-8, 16-18]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Beloved:  
I am already being poured out like a libation,  
and the time of my departure is at hand.  
I have competed well; I have finished the race;  
I have kept the faith.  
From now on the crown of righteousness awaits me,  
which the Lord, the just judge,  
will award to me on that day, and not only to me,  
but to all who have longed for his appearance.  
At my first defense no one appeared on my behalf,  
but everyone deserted me.  
May it not be held against them!  
But the Lord stood by me and gave me strength,  
so that through me the proclamation might be completed  
and all the Gentiles might hear it.  
And I was rescued from the lion's mouth.  
The Lord will rescue me from every evil threat  
and will bring me safe to his heavenly kingdom.  
To him be glory forever and ever. Amen.

#### Gospel Acclamation [2 Corinthians 5:19]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia, alleluia.**  
God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ,  
and entrusting to us the message of salvation. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Gospel [Luke 18:9-14]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus addressed this parable  
to those who were convinced of their own righteousness  
and despised everyone else.  
"Two people went up to the temple area to pray;  
one was a Pharisee and the other was a tax collector.  
The Pharisee took up his position and spoke this prayer to himself,  
'O God, I thank you that I am not like the rest of humanity --  
greedy, dishonest, adulterous -- or even like this tax collector.  
I fast twice a week, and I pay tithes on my whole income.'  
But the tax collector stood off at a distance  
and would not even raise his eyes to heaven  
but beat his breast and prayed,  
'O God, be merciful to me a sinner.'  
I tell you, the latter went home justified, not the former;  
for whoever exalts himself will be humbled,  
and the one who humbles himself will be exalted."
