#### First Reading [1 Kings 19:9a, 11-13a]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

At the mountain of God, Horeb,  
Elijah came to a cave where he took shelter.  
Then the LORD said to him,  
“Go outside and stand on the mountain before the LORD;  
the LORD will be passing by.”  
A strong and heavy wind was rending the mountains  
and crushing rocks before the LORD—  
but the LORD was not in the wind.  
After the wind there was an earthquake—  
but the LORD was not in the earthquake.  
After the earthquake there was fire—  
but the LORD was not in the fire.  
After the fire there was a tiny whispering sound.  
When he heard this,  
Elijah hid his face in his cloak  
and went and stood at the entrance of the cave.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 85:9, 10, 11-12, 13-14]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Lord, let us see your kindness, and grant us your salvation.**  

I will hear what God proclaims;  
the LORD — for he proclaims peace.  
Near indeed is his salvation to those who fear him,  
glory dwelling in our land. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Kindness and truth shall meet;  
justice and peace shall kiss.  
Truth shall spring out of the earth,  
and justice shall look down from heaven. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The LORD himself will give his benefits;  
our land shall yield its increase.  
Justice shall walk before him,  
and prepare the way of his steps. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Romans 9:1-5]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie;  
my conscience joins with the Holy Spirit in bearing me witness  
that I have great sorrow and constant anguish in my heart.  
For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ  
for the sake of my own people,  
my kindred according to the flesh.  
They are Israelites;  
theirs the adoption, the glory, the covenants,  
the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises;  
theirs the patriarchs, and from them,  
according to the flesh, is the Christ,  
who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.

#### Gospel [Matthew 14:22-33]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

After he had fed the people, Jesus made the disciples get into a boat  
and precede him to the other side,  
while he dismissed the crowds.  
After doing so, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray.  
When it was evening he was there alone.  
Meanwhile the boat, already a few miles offshore,  
was being tossed about by the waves, for the wind was against it.  
During the fourth watch of the night,  
he came toward them walking on the sea.   
When the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were terrified.  
“It is a ghost,” they said, and they cried out in fear.  
At once Jesus spoke to them, “Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid.”   
Peter said to him in reply,  
“Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.”  
He said, “Come.”  
Peter got out of the boat and began to walk on the water toward Jesus.  
But when he saw how strong the wind was he became frightened;  
and, beginning to sink, he cried out, “Lord, save me!”  
Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and caught Peter,  
and said to him, “O you of little faith, why did you doubt?”  
After they got into the boat, the wind died down.  
Those who were in the boat did him homage, saying,  
“Truly, you are the Son of God.”

#### First Reading [1 Kings 19:4-8]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Elijah went a day's journey into the desert,  
until he came to a broom tree and sat beneath it.  
He prayed for death saying:  
"This is enough, O LORD!  
Take my life, for I am no better than my fathers."  
He lay down and fell asleep under the broom tree,  
but then an angel touched him and ordered him to get up and eat.  
Elijah looked and there at his head was a hearth cake  
and a jug of water.  
After he ate and drank, he lay down again,  
but the angel of the LORD came back a second time,  
touched him, and ordered,  
"Get up and eat, else the journey will be too long for you!"  
He got up, ate, and drank;  
then strengthened by that food,  
he walked forty days and forty nights to the mountain of God, Horeb.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 34:2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.**  

I will bless the LORD at all times;  
his praise shall be ever in my mouth.  
Let my soul glory in the LORD;  
the lowly will hear me and be glad. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Glorify the LORD with me,  
Let us together extol his name.  
I sought the LORD, and he answered me  
And delivered me from all my fears. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Look to him that you may be radiant with joy.  
And your faces may not blush with shame.  
When the afflicted man called out, the LORD heard,  
And from all his distress he saved him. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The angel of the LORD encamps  
around those who fear him and delivers them.  
Taste and see how good the LORD is;  
blessed the man who takes refuge in him. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Ephesians 4:30—5:2]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God,  
with which you were sealed for the day of redemption.  
All bitterness, fury, anger, shouting, and reviling  
must be removed from you, along with all malice.  
And be kind to one another, compassionate,  
forgiving one another as God has forgiven you in Christ.  

So be imitators of God, as beloved children, and live in love,  
as Christ loved us and handed himself over for us  
as a sacrificial offering to God for a fragrant aroma.

whoever eats this bread will live forever. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Gospel [John 6:41-51]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

The Jews murmured about Jesus because he said,  
"I am the bread that came down from heaven,"  
and they said,  
"Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph?  
Do we not know his father and mother?  
Then how can he say,  
'I have come down from heaven'?"  
Jesus answered and said to them,  
"Stop murmuring among yourselves.  
No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draw him,  
and I will raise him on the last day.  
It is written in the prophets:  
*They shall all be taught by God.*  
Everyone who listens to my Father and learns from him comes to me.  
Not that anyone has seen the Father  
except the one who is from God;  
he has seen the Father.  
Amen, amen, I say to you,  
whoever believes has eternal life.  
I am the bread of life.  
Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert, but they died;  
this is the bread that comes down from heaven  
so that one may eat it and not die.  
I am the living bread that came down from heaven;  
whoever eats this bread will live forever;  
and the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world."

#### First Reading [Wisdom 18:6-9]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

The night of the passover was known beforehand to our fathers,  
that, with sure knowledge of the oaths in which they put their faith,  
they might have courage.  
Your people awaited the salvation of the just  
and the destruction of their foes.  
For when you punished our adversaries,  
in this you glorified us whom you had summoned.  
For in secret the holy children of the good were offering sacrifice  
and putting into effect with one accord the divine institution.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 33:1, 12, 18-19, 20-22]{style="float:right" .small}

**[℟.]{.red}** **Blessed the people the Lord has chosen to be his own.**  

Exult, you just, in the LORD;  
praise from the upright is fitting.  
Blessed the nation whose God is the LORD,  
the people he has chosen for his own inheritance. **[℟.]{.red}**  

See, the eyes of the LORD are upon those who fear him,  
upon those who hope for his kindness,  
To deliver them from death  
and preserve them in spite of famine. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Our soul waits for the LORD,  
who is our help and our shield.  
May your kindness, O LORD, be upon us  
who have put our hope in you. **[℟.]{.red}**

Brothers and sisters:  
Faith is the realization of what is hoped for  
and evidence of things not seen.  
Because of it the ancients were well attested.  

By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place  
that he was to receive as an inheritance;  
he went out, not knowing where he was to go.  
By faith he sojourned in the promised land as in a foreign country,  
dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs of the same promise;  
for he was looking forward to the city with foundations,  
whose architect and maker is God.  
By faith he received power to generate,  
even though he was past the normal age  
—and Sarah herself was sterile—  
for he thought that the one who had made the promise was
trustworthy.  
So it was that there came forth from one man,  
himself as good as dead,  
descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky  
and as countless as the sands on the seashore.  

All these died in faith.  
They did not receive what had been promised  
but saw it and greeted it from afar  
and acknowledged themselves to be strangers and aliens on earth,  
for those who speak thus show that they are seeking a homeland.  
If they had been thinking of the land from which they had come,  
they would have had opportunity to return.  
But now they desire a better homeland, a heavenly one.  
Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God,  
for he has prepared a city for them.  

By faith Abraham, when put to the test, offered up Isaac,  
and he who had received the promises was ready to offer his only son,  
of whom it was said,  
“Through Isaac descendants shall bear your name.”  
He reasoned that God was able to raise even from the dead,  
and he received Isaac back as a symbol.

#### Gospel [Luke 12:32-48 or 12:35-40]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus said to his disciples:  
“Do not be afraid any longer, little flock,  
for your Father is pleased to give you the kingdom.  
Sell your belongings and give alms.  
Provide money bags for yourselves that do not wear out,  
an inexhaustible treasure in heaven  
that no thief can reach nor moth destroy.  
For where your treasure is, there also will your heart be.  

“Gird your loins and light your lamps  
and be like servants who await their master’s return from a wedding,  
ready to open immediately when he comes and knocks.  
Blessed are those servants  
whom the master finds vigilant on his arrival.  
Amen, I say to you, he will gird himself,  
have them recline at table, and proceed to wait on them.  
And should he come in the second or third watch  
and find them prepared in this way,  
blessed are those servants.  
Be sure of this:  
if the master of the house had known the hour  
when the thief was coming,  
he would not have let his house be broken into.  
You also must be prepared, for at an hour you do not expect,  
the Son of Man will come.”  

Then Peter said,  
“Lord, is this parable meant for us or for everyone?”  
And the Lord replied,  
“Who, then, is the faithful and prudent steward  
whom the master will put in charge of his servants  
to distribute the food allowance at the proper time?  
Blessed is that servant whom his master on arrival finds doing so.  
Truly, I say to you, the master will put the servant  
in charge of all his property.  
But if that servant says to himself,  
‘My master is delayed in coming,’  
and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants,  
to eat and drink and get drunk,  
then that servant’s master will come  
on an unexpected day and at an unknown hour  
and will punish the servant severely  
and assign him a place with the unfaithful.  
That servant who knew his master’s will  
but did not make preparations nor act in accord with his will  
shall be beaten severely;  
and the servant who was ignorant of his master’s will  
but acted in a way deserving of a severe beating  
shall be beaten only lightly.  
Much will be required of the person entrusted with much,  
and still more will be demanded of the person entrusted with more.”
