### &nbsp; Year A

#### First Reading [Isaiah 25:6-10a]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

On this mountain the LORD of hosts  
will provide for all peoples  
a feast of rich food and choice wines,  
juicy, rich food and pure, choice wines.  
On this mountain he will destroy  
the veil that veils all peoples,  
the web that is woven over all nations;  
he will destroy death forever.  
The Lord GOD will wipe away  
the tears from every face;  
the reproach of his people he will remove  
from the whole earth; for the LORD has spoken.  
On that day it will be said:  
"Behold our God, to whom we looked to save us!  
This is the LORD for whom we looked;  
let us rejoice and be glad that he has saved us!"  
For the hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 23:1-3a, 3b-4, 5, 6]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **I shall live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.**  

The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.  
In verdant pastures he gives me repose;  
beside restful waters he leads me;  
he refreshes my soul. **[℟.]{.red}**  

He guides me in right paths  
for his name's sake.  
Even though I walk in the dark valley  
I fear no evil; for you are at my side  
with your rod and your staff  
that give me courage. **[℟.]{.red}**  

You spread the table before me  
in the sight of my foes;  
you anoint my head with oil;  
my cup overflows. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Only goodness and kindness follow me  
all the days of my life;  
and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD  
for years to come. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Philippians 4:12-14, 19-20]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
I know how to live in humble circumstances;  
I know also how to live with abundance.  
In every circumstance and in all things  
I have learned the secret of being well fed and of going hungry,  
of living in abundance and of being in need.  
I can do all things in him who strengthens me.   
Still, it was kind of you to share in my distress.  

My God will fully supply whatever you need,  
in accord with his glorious riches in Christ Jesus.  
To our God and Father, glory forever and ever. Amen.

#### Gospel [Matthew 22:1-14 or 22:1-10]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus again in reply spoke to the chief priests and elders of the people  
in parables, saying,  
"The kingdom of heaven may be likened to a king  
who gave a wedding feast for his son.  
He dispatched his servants  
to summon the invited guests to the feast,  
but they refused to come.  
A second time he sent other servants, saying,  
'Tell those invited: "Behold, I have prepared my banquet,  
my calves and fattened cattle are killed,  
and everything is ready; come to the feast."'  
Some ignored the invitation and went away,  
one to his farm, another to his business.  
The rest laid hold of his servants,  
mistreated them, and killed them.  
The king was enraged and sent his troops,  
destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.  
Then he said to his servants, 'The feast is ready,  
but those who were invited were not worthy to come.  
Go out, therefore, into the main roads  
and invite to the feast whomever you find.'  
The servants went out into the streets  
and gathered all they found, bad and good alike,  
and the hall was filled with guests.  
But when the king came in to meet the guests,  
he saw a man there not dressed in a wedding garment.  
The king said to him, 'My friend, how is it  
that you came in here without a wedding garment?'  
But he was reduced to silence.  
Then the king said to his attendants, 'Bind his hands and feet,  
and cast him into the darkness outside,  
where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.'  
Many are invited, but few are chosen."

### &nbsp; Year B

#### First Reading [Wisdom 7:7-11]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

I prayed, and prudence was given me;  
&emsp; I pleaded, and the spirit of wisdom came to me.  
I preferred her to scepter and throne,  
and deemed riches nothing in comparison with her,  
&emsp; nor did I liken any priceless gem to her;  
because all gold, in view of her, is a little sand,  
&emsp; and before her, silver is to be accounted mire.  
Beyond health and comeliness I loved her,  
and I chose to have her rather than the light,  
&emsp; because the splendor of her never yields to sleep.  
Yet all good things together came to me in her company,  
&emsp; and countless riches at her hands.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 90:12-13, 14-15, 16-17]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Fill us with your love, O Lord, and we will sing for joy!**  

Teach us to number our days aright,  
&emsp; that we may gain wisdom of heart.  
Return, O LORD! How long?  
&emsp; Have pity on your servants! **[℟.]{.red}**  

Fill us at daybreak with your kindness,  
&emsp; that we may shout for joy and gladness all our days.  
Make us glad, for the days when you afflicted us,  
&emsp; for the years when we saw evil. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Let your work be seen by your servants  
&emsp; and your glory by their children;  
and may the gracious care of the LORD our God be ours;  
&emsp; prosper the work of our hands for us!  
&emsp; Prosper the work of our hands! **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Hebrews 4:12-13]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
Indeed the word of God is living and effective,  
sharper than any two-edged sword,  
penetrating even between soul and spirit, joints and marrow,  
and able to discern reflections and thoughts of the heart.  
No creature is concealed from him,  
but everything is naked and exposed to the eyes of him  
to whom we must render an account.

#### Gospel [Mark 10:17-30 or 10:17-27]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

As Jesus was setting out on a journey, a man ran up,  
knelt down before him, and asked him,  
"Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"  
Jesus answered him, "Why do you call me good?  
No one is good but God alone.  
You know the commandments:  
*You shall not kill;*  
*you shall not commit adultery;*  
*you shall not steal;*  
*you shall not bear false witness;*  
*you shall not defraud;*  
*honor your father and your mother.*"  
He replied and said to him,  
"Teacher, all of these I have observed from my youth."  
Jesus, looking at him, loved him and said to him,  
"You are lacking in one thing.  
Go, sell what you have, and give to the poor  
and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me."  
At that statement his face fell,  
and he went away sad, for he had many possessions.  

Jesus looked around and said to his disciples,  
"How hard it is for those who have wealth  
to enter the kingdom of God!"  
The disciples were amazed at his words.  
So Jesus again said to them in reply,  
"Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!  
It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle  
than for one who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."  
They were exceedingly astonished and said among themselves,  
"Then who can be saved?"  
Jesus looked at them and said,  
"For human beings it is impossible, but not for God.  
All things are possible for God."  
Peter began to say to him,  
"We have given up everything and followed you."  
Jesus said, "Amen, I say to you,  
there is no one who has given up house or brothers or sisters  
or mother or father or children or lands  
for my sake and for the sake of the gospel  
who will not receive a hundred times more now in this present age:  
houses and brothers and sisters  
and mothers and children and lands,  
with persecutions, and eternal life in the age to come."

#### First Reading [2 Kings 5:14-17]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Naaman went down and plunged into the Jordan seven times  
at the word of Elisha, the man of God.  
His flesh became again like the flesh of a little child,  
and he was clean of his leprosy.  

Naaman returned with his whole retinue to the man of God.  
On his arrival he stood before Elisha and said,  
"Now I know that there is no God in all the earth,  
except in Israel.  
Please accept a gift from your servant."  

Elisha replied, "As the LORD lives whom I serve, I will not take it;"  
and despite Naaman's urging, he still refused.  
Naaman said: "If you will not accept,  
please let me, your servant, have two mule-loads of earth,  
for I will no longer offer holocaust or sacrifice  
to any other god except to the LORD."

**[℟.]{.red}** **The Lord has revealed to the nations his saving power.**  

Sing to the LORD a new song,  
for he has done wondrous deeds;  
his right hand has won victory for him,  
his holy arm. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The LORD has made his salvation known:  
in the sight of the nations he has revealed his justice.  
He has remembered his kindness and his faithfulness  
toward the house of Israel. **[℟.]{.red}**  

All the ends of the earth have seen  
the salvation by our God.  
Sing joyfully to the LORD, all you lands:  
break into song; sing praise. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [2 Timothy 2:8-13]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Beloved:  
Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David:  
such is my gospel, for which I am suffering,  
even to the point of chains, like a criminal.  
But the word of God is not chained.  
Therefore, I bear with everything for the sake of those who are chosen,  
so that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus,  
together with eternal glory.  
This saying is trustworthy:  
If we have died with him  
we shall also live with him;  
if we persevere  
we shall also reign with him.  
But if we deny him  
he will deny us.  
If we are unfaithful  
he remains faithful,  
for he cannot deny himself.

#### Gospel [Luke 17:11-19]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

As Jesus continued his journey to Jerusalem,  
he traveled through Samaria and Galilee.  
As he was entering a village, ten lepers met him.  
They stood at a distance from him and raised their voices, saying,  
"Jesus, Master! Have pity on us!"  
And when he saw them, he said,  
"Go show yourselves to the priests."  
As they were going they were cleansed.  
And one of them, realizing he had been healed,  
returned, glorifying God in a loud voice;  
and he fell at the feet of Jesus and thanked him.  
He was a Samaritan.  
Jesus said in reply,  
"Ten were cleansed, were they not?  
Where are the other nine?  
Has none but this foreigner returned to give thanks to God?"  
Then he said to him, "Stand up and go;  
your faith has saved you."
