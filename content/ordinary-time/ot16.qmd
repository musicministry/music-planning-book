### &nbsp; Year A

#### First Reading [Wisdom 12:13, 16-19]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

There is no god besides you who have the care of all,  
that you need show you have not unjustly condemned.  
For your might is the source of justice;  
your mastery over all things makes you lenient to all.  
For you show your might when the perfection of your power is disbelieved;  
and in those who know you, you rebuke temerity.  
But though you are master of might, you judge with clemency,  
and with much lenience you govern us;  
for power, whenever you will, attends you.  
And you taught your people, by these deeds,  
that those who are just must be kind;  
and you gave your children good ground for hope  
that you would permit repentance for their sins.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 86:5-6, 9-10, 15-16]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Lord, you are good and forgiving.**  

You, O LORD, are good and forgiving,  
abounding in kindness to all who call upon you.  
Hearken, O LORD, to my prayer  
and attend to the sound of my pleading. **[℟.]{.red}**  

All the nations you have made shall come  
and worship you, O LORD,  
and glorify your name.  
For you are great, and you do wondrous deeds;  
you alone are God. **[℟.]{.red}**  

You, O LORD, are a God merciful and gracious,  
slow to anger, abounding in kindness and fidelity.  
Turn toward me, and have pity on me;  
give your strength to your servant. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Romans 8:26-27]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
The Spirit comes to the aid of our weakness;  
for we do not know how to pray as we ought,  
but the Spirit himself intercedes with inexpressible groanings.  
And the one who searches hearts  
knows what is the intention of the Spirit,  
because he intercedes for the holy ones  
according to God's will.

#### Gospel Acclamation [Cf. Matthew 11:25]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia, alleluia.**  
Blessed are you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth;  
you have revealed to little ones the mysteries of the kingdom. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Gospel [Matthew 13:24-43 or 13:24-30]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus proposed another parable to the crowds, saying:  
"The kingdom of heaven may be likened  
to a man who sowed good seed in his field.  
While everyone was asleep his enemy came  
and sowed weeds all through the wheat, and then went off.  
When the crop grew and bore fruit, the weeds appeared as well.  
The slaves of the householder came to him and said,  
'Master, did you not sow good seed in your field?  
Where have the weeds come from?'  
He answered, 'An enemy has done this.'  
His slaves said to him,  
'Do you want us to go and pull them up?'  
He replied, 'No, if you pull up the weeds  
you might uproot the wheat along with them.   
Let them grow together until harvest;  
then at harvest time I will say to the harvesters,  
"First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles for burning;  
but gather the wheat into my barn."'"  

He proposed another parable to them.  
"The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed  
that a person took and sowed in a field.  
It is the smallest of all the seeds,  
yet when full-grown it is the largest of plants.  
It becomes a large bush,  
and the 'birds of the sky come and dwell in its branches.'"  

He spoke to them another parable.  
"The kingdom of heaven is like yeast  
that a woman took and mixed with three measures of wheat flour  
until the whole batch was leavened."  

All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables.  
He spoke to them only in parables,  
to fulfill what had been said through the prophet:  
I will open my mouth in parables,  
I will announce what has lain hidden from the foundation
of the world.  

Then, dismissing the crowds, he went into the house.  
His disciples approached him and said,  
"Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."  
He said in reply, "He who sows good seed is the Son of Man,  
the field is the world, the good seed the children of the kingdom.  
The weeds are the children of the evil one,  
and the enemy who sows them is the devil.  
The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.  
Just as weeds are collected and burned up with fire,  
so will it be at the end of the age.  
The Son of Man will send his angels,  
and they will collect out of his kingdom  
all who cause others to sin and all evildoers.  
They will throw them into the fiery furnace,  
where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.  
Then the righteous will shine like the sun  
in the kingdom of their Father.  
Whoever has ears ought to hear."

### &nbsp; Year B

#### First Reading [Jeremiah 23:1-6]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Woe to the shepherds  
who mislead and scatter the flock of my pasture,  
says the LORD.  
Therefore, thus says the LORD, the God of Israel,  
against the shepherds who shepherd my people:  
You have scattered my sheep and driven them away.  
You have not cared for them,  
but I will take care to punish your evil deeds.  
I myself will gather the remnant of my flock  
from all the lands to which I have driven them  
and bring them back to their meadow;  
there they shall increase and multiply.  
I will appoint shepherds for them who will shepherd them  
so that they need no longer fear and tremble;  
and none shall be missing, says the LORD.  

Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD,  
when I will raise up a righteous shoot to David;  
as king he shall reign and govern wisely,  
he shall do what is just and right in the land.  
In his days Judah shall be saved,  
Israel shall dwell in security.  
This is the name they give him:  
"The LORD our justice."

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 23:1-3, 3-4, 5, 6]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.**  

The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.  
In verdant pastures he gives me repose;  
beside restful waters he leads me;  
he refreshes my soul. **[℟.]{.red}**  

He guides me in right paths  
for his name's sake.  
Even though I walk in the dark valley  
I fear no evil; for you are at my side  
with your rod and your staff  
that give me courage. **[℟.]{.red}**  

You spread the table before me  
in the sight of my foes;  
you anoint my head with oil;  
my cup overflows. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Only goodness and kindness follow me  
all the days of my life;  
and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD  
for years to come. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Ephesians 2:13-18]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
In Christ Jesus you who once were far off  
have become near by the blood of Christ.  

For he is our peace, he who made both one  
and broke down the dividing wall of enmity, through his flesh,  
abolishing the law with its commandments and legal claims,  
that he might create in himself one new person in place of the two,  
thus establishing peace,  
and might reconcile both with God,  
in one body, through the cross,  
putting that enmity to death by it.  
He came and preached peace to you who were far off  
and peace to those who were near,  
for through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.

#### Gospel [Mark 6:30-34]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

The apostles gathered together with Jesus  
and reported all they had done and taught.  
He said to them,  
“Come away by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while.”  
People were coming and going in great numbers,  
and they had no opportunity even to eat.  
So they went off in the boat by themselves to a deserted place.  
People saw them leaving and many came to know about it.  
They hastened there on foot from all the towns  
and arrived at the place before them.  

When he disembarked and saw the vast crowd,  
his heart was moved with pity for them,  
for they were like sheep without a shepherd;  
and he began to teach them many things.

#### First Reading [Genesis 18:1-10a]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

The LORD appeared to Abraham by the terebinth of Mamre,  
as he sat in the entrance of his tent,  
while the day was growing hot.  
Looking up, Abraham saw three men standing nearby.  
When he saw them, he ran from the entrance of the tent to greet them;  
and bowing to the ground, he said:  
"Sir, if I may ask you this favor,  
please do not go on past your servant.  
Let some water be brought, that you may bathe your feet,  
and then rest yourselves under the tree.  
Now that you have come this close to your servant,  
let me bring you a little food, that you may refresh yourselves;  
and afterward you may go on your way."  
The men replied, "Very well, do as you have said."  

Abraham hastened into the tent and told Sarah,  
"Quick, three measures of fine flour! Knead it and make rolls."  
He ran to the herd, picked out a tender, choice steer,  
and gave it to a servant, who quickly prepared it.  
Then Abraham got some curds and milk,  
as well as the steer that had been prepared,  
and set these before the three men;  
and he waited on them under the tree while they ate.  

They asked Abraham, "Where is your wife Sarah?"  
He replied, "There in the tent."  
One of them said, "I will surely return to you about this time next year,  
and Sarah will then have a son."

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 15:2-3, 3-4, 5]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **He who does justice will live in the presence of the Lord.**  

One who walks blamelessly and does justice;  
who thinks the truth in his heart  
and slanders not with his tongue. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Who harms not his fellow man,  
nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor;  
by whom the reprobate is despised,  
while he honors those who fear the LORD. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Who lends not his money at usury  
and accepts no bribe against the innocent.  
One who does these things  
shall never be disturbed. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Colossians 1:24-28]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake,  
and in my flesh I am filling up  
what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ  
on behalf of his body, which is the church,  
of which I am a minister  
in accordance with God's stewardship given to me  
to bring to completion for you the word of God,  
the mystery hidden from ages and from generations past.  
But now it has been manifested to his holy ones,  
to whom God chose to make known the riches of the glory  
of this mystery among the Gentiles;  
it is Christ in you, the hope for glory.  
It is he whom we proclaim,  
admonishing everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom,  
that we may present everyone perfect in Christ.

:::

Jesus entered a village  
where a woman whose name was Martha welcomed him.  
She had a sister named Mary  
who sat beside the Lord at his feet listening to him speak.  
Martha, burdened with much serving, came to him and said,  
"Lord, do you not care  
that my sister has left me by myself to do the serving?  
Tell her to help me."  
The Lord said to her in reply,  
"Martha, Martha, you are anxious and worried about many things.  
There is need of only one thing.  
Mary has chosen the better part  
and it will not be taken from her."
