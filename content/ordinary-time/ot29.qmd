#### First Reading [Isaiah 45:1, 4-6]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Thus says the LORD to his anointed, Cyrus,  
whose right hand I grasp,  
subduing nations before him,  
and making kings run in his service,  
opening doors before him  
and leaving the gates unbarred:  
For the sake of Jacob, my servant,  
of Israel, my chosen one,  
I have called you by your name,  
giving you a title, though you knew me not.  
I am the LORD and there is no other,  
there is no God besides me.  
It is I who arm you, though you know me not,  
so that toward the rising and the setting of the sun  
people may know that there is none besides me.  
I am the LORD, there is no other.

:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Give the Lord glory and honor.**  

Sing to the LORD a new song;  
sing to the LORD, all you lands.  
Tell his glory among the nations;  
among all peoples, his wondrous deeds. **[℟.]{.red}**  

For great is the LORD and highly to be praised;  
awesome is he, beyond all gods.  
For all the gods of the nations are things of nought,  
but the LORD made the heavens. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Give to the LORD, you families of nations,  
give to the LORD glory and praise;  
give to the LORD the glory due his name!  
Bring gifts, and enter his courts. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Worship the LORD, in holy attire;  
tremble before him, all the earth;  
say among the nations: The LORD is king,  
he governs the peoples with equity. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [1 Thessalonians 1:1-5b]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians  
in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:  
grace to you and peace.  
We give thanks to God always for all of you,  
remembering you in our prayers,  
unceasingly calling to mind your work of faith and labor of love  
and endurance in hope of our Lord Jesus Christ,  
before our God and Father,  
knowing, brothers and sisters loved by God,  
how you were chosen.  
For our gospel did not come to you in word alone,  
but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with much conviction.

#### Gospel [Matthew 22:15-21]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

The Pharisees went off  
and plotted how they might entrap Jesus in speech.  
They sent their disciples to him, with the Herodians, saying,  
"Teacher, we know that you are a truthful man  
and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.  
And you are not concerned with anyone's opinion,  
for you do not regard a person's status.  
Tell us, then, what is your opinion:  
Is it lawful to pay the census tax to Caesar or not?"  
Knowing their malice, Jesus said,  
"Why are you testing me, you hypocrites?  
Show me the coin that pays the census tax."  
Then they handed him the Roman coin.  
He said to them, "Whose image is this and whose inscription?"  
They replied, "Caesar's."  
At that he said to them,  
"Then repay to Caesar what belongs to Caesar  
and to God what belongs to God."

#### First Reading [Isaiah 53:10-11]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

The LORD was pleased  
&emsp; to crush him in infirmity.  

If he gives his life as an offering for sin,  
&emsp; he shall see his descendants in a long life,  
&emsp; and the will of the LORD shall be accomplished through him.  

Because of his affliction  
&emsp; he shall see the light in fullness of days;  
through his suffering, my servant shall justify many,  
&emsp; and their guilt he shall bear.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 33:4-5, 18-19, 20, 22]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Lord, let your mercy be on us, as we place our trust in you.**  

Upright is the word of the LORD,  
&emsp; and all his works are trustworthy.  
He loves justice and right;  
&emsp; of the kindness of the LORD the earth is full. **[℟.]{.red}**  

See, the eyes of the LORD are upon those who fear him,  
&emsp; upon those who hope for his kindness,  
To deliver them from death  
&emsp; and preserve them in spite of famine. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Our soul waits for the LORD,  
&emsp; who is our help and our shield.  
May your kindness, O LORD, be upon us  
&emsp; who have put our hope in you. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Hebrews 4:14-16]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
Since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens,  
Jesus, the Son of God,  
let us hold fast to our confession.  
For we do not have a high priest  
who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses,  
but one who has similarly been tested in every way,  
yet without sin.  
So let us confidently approach the throne of grace  
to receive mercy and to find grace for timely help.

#### Gospel [Mark 10:35-45 or 10:42-45]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Jesus and said to him,  
"Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you."  
He replied, "What do you wish me to do for you?"  
They answered him, "Grant that in your glory  
we may sit one at your right and the other at your left."  
Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking.  
Can you drink the cup that I drink  
or be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?"  
They said to him, "We can."  
Jesus said to them, "The cup that I drink, you will drink,  
and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized;  
but to sit at my right or at my left is not mine to give  
but is for those for whom it has been prepared."  
When the ten heard this, they became indignant at James and John.  
Jesus summoned them and said to them,  
"You know that those who are recognized as rulers over the Gentiles
lord it over them,  
and their great ones make their authority over them felt.  
But it shall not be so among you.  
Rather, whoever wishes to be great among you will be your servant;  
whoever wishes to be first among you will be the slave of all.  
For the Son of Man did not come to be served  
but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many."  

[Or:]{.red}  

Jesus summoned the twelve and said to them,  
"You know that those who are recognized as rulers over the Gentiles
lord it over them,  
and their great ones make their authority over them felt.  
But it shall not be so among you.  
Rather, whoever wishes to be great among you will be your servant;  
whoever wishes to be first among you will be the slave of all.  
For the Son of Man did not come to be served  
but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many."

#### First Reading [Exodus 17:8-13]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

In those days, Amalek came and waged war against Israel.  
Moses, therefore, said to Joshua,  
"Pick out certain men,  
and tomorrow go out and engage Amalek in battle.  
I will be standing on top of the hill  
with the staff of God in my hand."  
So Joshua did as Moses told him:  
he engaged Amalek in battle  
after Moses had climbed to the top of the hill with Aaron and Hur.  
As long as Moses kept his hands raised up,  
Israel had the better of the fight,  
but when he let his hands rest,  
Amalek had the better of the fight.  
Moses'hands, however, grew tired;  
so they put a rock in place for him to sit on.  
Meanwhile Aaron and Hur supported his hands,  
one on one side and one on the other,  
so that his hands remained steady till sunset.  
And Joshua mowed down Amalek and his people  
with the edge of the sword.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 121:1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Our help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.**  

I lift up my eyes toward the mountains;  
whence shall help come to me?  
My help is from the LORD,  
who made heaven and earth. **[℟.]{.red}**  

May he not suffer your foot to slip;  
may he slumber not who guards you:  
indeed he neither slumbers nor sleeps,  
the guardian of Israel. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The LORD is your guardian; the LORD is your shade;  
he is beside you at your right hand.  
The sun shall not harm you by day,  
nor the moon by night. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The LORD will guard you from all evil;  
he will guard your life.  
The LORD will guard your coming and your going,  
both now and forever. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [2 Timothy 3:14-4:2]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Beloved:  
Remain faithful to what you have learned and believed,  
because you know from whom you learned it,  
and that from infancy you have known the sacred Scriptures,  
which are capable of giving you wisdom for salvation  
through faith in Christ Jesus.  
All Scripture is inspired by God  
and is useful for teaching, for refutation, for correction,  
and for training in righteousness,  
so that one who belongs to God may be competent,  
equipped for every good work.  

I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus,  
who will judge the living and the dead,  
and by his appearing and his kingly power:  
proclaim the word;  
be persistent whether it is convenient or inconvenient;  
convince, reprimand, encourage through all patience and teaching.

**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia, alleluia.**

discerning reflections and thoughts of the heart. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Gospel [Luke 18:1-8]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus told his disciples a parable  
about the necessity for them to pray always without becoming weary.  
He said, "There was a judge in a certain town  
who neither feared God nor respected any human being.  
And a widow in that town used to come to him and say,  
'Render a just decision for me against my adversary.'  
For a long time the judge was unwilling, but eventually he thought,  
'While it is true that I neither fear God nor respect any human being,  
because this widow keeps bothering me  
I shall deliver a just decision for her  
lest she finally come and strike me.'"  
The Lord said, "Pay attention to what the dishonest judge says.  
Will not God then secure the rights of his chosen ones  
who call out to him day and night?  
Will he be slow to answer them?  
I tell you, he will see to it that justice is done for them speedily.  
But when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?"
