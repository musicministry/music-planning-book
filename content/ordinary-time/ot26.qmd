### &nbsp; Year A

#### First Reading [Ezekiel 18:25-28]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Thus says the LORD:  
You say, "The LORD's way is not fair!"  
Hear now, house of Israel:  
Is it my way that is unfair, or rather, are not your ways unfair?  
When someone virtuous turns away from virtue to commit iniquity, and dies,  
it is because of the iniquity he committed that he must die.  
But if he turns from the wickedness he has committed,  
and does what is right and just,  
he shall preserve his life;  
since he has turned away from all the sins that he has committed,  
he shall surely live, he shall not die.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 25:4-5, 6-7, 8-9]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Remember your mercies, O Lord.**  

Your ways, O LORD, make known to me;  
teach me your paths,  
guide me in your truth and teach me,  
for you are God my savior. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Remember that your compassion, O LORD,  
and your love are from of old.  
The sins of my youth and my frailties remember not;  
in your kindness remember me,  
because of your goodness, O LORD. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Good and upright is the LORD;  
thus he shows sinners the way.  
He guides the humble to justice,   
and teaches the humble his way. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Philippians 2:1-11 or 2:1-5]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
If there is any encouragement in Christ,  
any solace in love,  
any participation in the Spirit,  
any compassion and mercy,  
complete my joy by being of the same mind, with the same love,  
united in heart, thinking one thing.  
Do nothing out of selfishness or out of vainglory;  
rather, humbly regard others as more important than yourselves,  
each looking out not for his own interests,  
but also for those of others.  

Have in you the same attitude  
that is also in Christ Jesus,  
Who, though he was in the form of God,  
did not regard equality with God  
something to be grasped.  
Rather, he emptied himself,  
taking the form of a slave,  
coming in human likeness;  
and found human in appearance,  
he humbled himself,  
becoming obedient to the point of death,  
even death on a cross.  
Because of this, God greatly exalted him  
and bestowed on him the name  
which is above every name,  
that at the name of Jesus  
every knee should bend,  
of those in heaven and on earth and under the earth,  
and every tongue confess that  
Jesus Christ is Lord,  
to the glory of God the Father.

#### Gospel [Matthew 21:28-32]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus said to the chief priests and elders of the people:  
"What is your opinion?  
A man had two sons.  
He came to the first and said,  
'Son, go out and work in the vineyard today.'  
He said in reply, 'I will not,'  
but afterwards changed his mind and went.  
The man came to the other son and gave the same order.  
He said in reply, 'Yes, sir, 'but did not go.  
Which of the two did his father's will?"  
They answered, "The first."  
Jesus said to them, "Amen, I say to you,  
tax collectors and prostitutes  
are entering the kingdom of God before you.  
When John came to you in the way of righteousness,  
you did not believe him;  
but tax collectors and prostitutes did.  
Yet even when you saw that,  
you did not later change your minds and believe him."

### &nbsp; Year B

#### First Reading [Numbers 11:25-29]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

The LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to Moses.  
Taking some of the spirit that was on Moses,  
the LORD bestowed it on the seventy elders;  
and as the spirit came to rest on them, they prophesied.  

Now two men, one named Eldad and the other Medad,  
were not in the gathering but had been left in the camp.  
They too had been on the list, but had not gone out to the tent;  
yet the spirit came to rest on them also,  
and they prophesied in the camp.  
So, when a young man quickly told Moses,  
"Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp,"  
Joshua, son of Nun, who from his youth had been Moses' aide, said,  
"Moses, my lord, stop them."  
But Moses answered him,  
"Are you jealous for my sake?  
Would that all the people of the LORD were prophets!  
Would that the LORD might bestow his spirit on them all!"

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 19:8, 10, 12-13, 14]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **The precepts of the Lord give joy to the heart.**  

The law of the LORD is perfect,  
refreshing the soul;  
the decree of the LORD is trustworthy,  
giving wisdom to the simple. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The fear of the LORD is pure,  
enduring forever;  
the ordinances of the LORD are true,  
all of them just. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Though your servant is careful of them,  
very diligent in keeping them,  
yet who can detect failings?  
Cleanse me from my unknown faults! **[℟.]{.red}**  

From wanton sin especially, restrain your servant;  
let it not rule over me.  
Then shall I be blameless and innocent  
of serious sin. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [James 5:1-6]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Come now, you rich, weep and wail over your impending miseries.  
Your wealth has rotted away, your clothes have become moth-eaten,  
your gold and silver have corroded,  
and that corrosion will be a testimony against you;  
it will devour your flesh like a fire.  
You have stored up treasure for the last days.  
Behold, the wages you withheld from the workers  
who harvested your fields are crying aloud;  
and the cries of the harvesters  
have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts.  
You have lived on earth in luxury and pleasure;  
you have fattened your hearts for the day of slaughter.  
You have condemned;  
you have murdered the righteous one;  
he offers you no resistance.

consecrate us in the truth. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Gospel [Mark 9:38-43, 45, 47-48]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

At that time, John said to Jesus,  
"Teacher, we saw someone driving out demons in your name,  
and we tried to prevent him because he does not follow us."  
Jesus replied, "Do not prevent him.  
There is no one who performs a mighty deed in my name  
who can at the same time speak ill of me.  
For whoever is not against us is for us.  
Anyone who gives you a cup of water to drink  
because you belong to Christ,  
amen, I say to you, will surely not lose his reward.  

"Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin,  
it would be better for him if a great millstone  
were put around his neck  
and he were thrown into the sea.  
If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off.  
It is better for you to enter into life maimed  
than with two hands to go into Gehenna,  
into the unquenchable fire.  
And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off.  
It is better for you to enter into life crippled  
than with two feet to be thrown into Gehenna.  
And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out.  
Better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye  
than with two eyes to be thrown into Gehenna,  
where 'their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.'"

### &nbsp; Year C

#### First Reading [Amos 6:1a, 4-7]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Thus says the LORD the God of hosts:  
Woe to the complacent in Zion!  
Lying upon beds of ivory,  
stretched comfortably on their couches,  
they eat lambs taken from the flock,  
and calves from the stall!  
Improvising to the music of the harp,  
like David, they devise their own accompaniment.  
They drink wine from bowls  
and anoint themselves with the best oils;  
yet they are not made ill by the collapse of Joseph!  
Therefore, now they shall be the first to go into exile,  
and their wanton revelry shall be done away with.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 146:7, 8-9, 9-10]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Praise the Lord, my soul!**  
[Or:]{.red}  
**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia.**  

Blessed is he who keeps faith forever,  
secures justice for the oppressed,  
gives food to the hungry.  
The LORD sets captives free. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The LORD gives sight to the blind;  
the LORD raises up those who were bowed down.  
The LORD loves the just;  
the LORD protects strangers. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The fatherless and the widow he sustains,  
but the way of the wicked he thwarts.  
The LORD shall reign forever;  
your God, O Zion, through all generations. Alleluia. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [1 Timothy 6:11-16]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

But you, man of God, pursue righteousness,  
devotion, faith, love, patience, and gentleness.  
Compete well for the faith.  
Lay hold of eternal life, to which you were called  
when you made the noble confession in the presence of many witnesses.  
I charge you before God, who gives life to all things,  
and before Christ Jesus,  
who gave testimony under Pontius Pilate for the noble confession,  
to keep the commandment without stain or reproach  
until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ  
that the blessed and only ruler  
will make manifest at the proper time,  
the King of kings and Lord of lords,  
who alone has immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light,  
and whom no human being has seen or can see.  
To him be honor and eternal power. Amen.

so that by his poverty you might become rich. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Gospel [Luke 16:19-31]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus said to the Pharisees:  
"There was a rich man who dressed in purple garments and fine linen  
and dined sumptuously each day.  
And lying at his door was a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores,  
who would gladly have eaten his fill of the scraps  
that fell from the rich man's table.  
Dogs even used to come and lick his sores.  
When the poor man died,  
he was carried away by angels to the bosom of Abraham.  
The rich man also died and was buried,  
and from the netherworld, where he was in torment,  
he raised his eyes and saw Abraham far off  
and Lazarus at his side.  
And he cried out, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me.  
Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue,  
for I am suffering torment in these flames.'  
Abraham replied,  
'My child, remember that you received  
what was good during your lifetime  
while Lazarus likewise received what was bad;  
but now he is comforted here, whereas you are tormented.  
Moreover, between us and you a great chasm is established  
to prevent anyone from crossing who might wish to go  
from our side to yours or from your side to ours.'  
He said, 'Then I beg you, father,  
send him to my father's house, for I have five brothers,  
so that he may warn them,  
lest they too come to this place of torment.'  
But Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the prophets.  
Let them listen to them.'  
He said, 'Oh no, father Abraham,  
but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.'  
Then Abraham said, 'If they will not listen to Moses and the prophets,  
neither will they be persuaded if someone should rise from the dead.'"
