#### First Reading [Isaiah 22:19-23]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Thus says the LORD to Shebna, master of the palace:  
"I will thrust you from your office  
and pull you down from your station.  
On that day I will summon my servant  
Eliakim, son of Hilkiah;  
I will clothe him with your robe,  
and gird him with your sash,  
and give over to him your authority.  
He shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,  
and to the house of Judah.  
I will place the key of the House of David on Eliakim's shoulder;  
when he opens, no one shall shut,  
when he shuts, no one shall open.  
I will fix him like a peg in a sure spot,  
to be a place of honor for his family."

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 138:1-2, 2-3, 6, 8]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Lord, your love is eternal; do not forsake the work of your hands.**  

I will give thanks to you, O LORD, with all my heart,  
for you have heard the words of my mouth;  
in the presence of the angels I will sing your praise;  
I will worship at your holy temple. **[℟.]{.red}**  

I will give thanks to your name,  
because of your kindness and your truth:  
When I called, you answered me;  
you built up strength within me. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The LORD is exalted, yet the lowly he sees,  
and the proud he knows from afar.  
Your kindness, O LORD, endures forever;  
forsake not the work of your hands. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Romans 11:33-36]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God!  
How inscrutable are his judgments and how unsearchable his ways!  
*For who has known the mind of the Lord*  
*or who has been his counselor?*  
*Or who has given the Lord anything*  
*that he may be repaid?*  
For from him and through him and for him are all things.  
To him be glory forever. Amen.

#### Gospel Acclamation [Matthew 16:18]{style="float:right" .small}

**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia, alleluia.**  
You are Peter and upon this rock I will build my Church  
and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Gospel [Matthew 16:13-20]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus went into the region of Caesarea Philippi and  
he asked his disciples,  
"Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"  
They replied, "Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah,  
still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."  
He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"  
Simon Peter said in reply,  
"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."  
Jesus said to him in reply,  
"Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah.  
For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my heavenly Father.  
And so I say to you, you are Peter,  
and upon this rock I will build my church,  
and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it.  
I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven.  
Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven;  
and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."  
Then he strictly ordered his disciples  
to tell no one that he was the Christ.

#### First Reading [Joshua 24:1-2a, 15-17, 18b]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Joshua gathered together all the tribes of Israel at Shechem,  
summoning their elders, their leaders,  
their judges, and their officers.  
When they stood in ranks before God,  
Joshua addressed all the people:  
"If it does not please you to serve the LORD,  
decide today whom you will serve,  
the gods your fathers served beyond the River  
or the gods of the Amorites in whose country you are now dwelling.  
As for me and my household, we will serve the LORD."  

But the people answered,  
"Far be it from us to forsake the LORD  
for the service of other gods.  
For it was the LORD, our God,  
who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt,  
out of a state of slavery.  
He performed those great miracles before our very eyes  
and protected us along our entire journey  
and among the peoples through whom we passed.  
Therefore we also will serve the LORD, for he is our God."  

::: {.red}
#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 34:2-3, 16-17, 18-19, 20-21]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.**  

I will bless the LORD at all times;  
his praise shall be ever in my mouth.  
Let my soul glory in the LORD;  
the lowly will hear me and be glad. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The LORD has eyes for the just,  
and ears for their cry.  
The LORD confronts the evildoers,  
to destroy remembrance of them from the earth. **[℟.]{.red}**  

When the just cry out, the LORD hears them,  
and from all their distress he rescues them.  
The LORD is close to the brokenhearted;  
and those who are crushed in spirit he saves. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Many are the troubles of the just one,  
but out of them all the LORD delivers him;  
he watches over all his bones;  
not one of them shall be broken. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Ephesians 5:21-32 or 5:2a, 25-32]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
Be subordinate to one another out of reverence for Christ.  
Wives should be subordinate to their husbands as to the Lord.  
For the husband is head of his wife  
just as Christ is head of the church,  
he himself the savior of the body.  
As the church is subordinate to Christ,  
so wives should be subordinate to their husbands in everything.  
Husbands, love your wives,  
even as Christ loved the church  
and handed himself over for her to sanctify her,  
cleansing her by the bath of water with the word,  
that he might present to himself the church in splendor,  
without spot or wrinkle or any such thing,  
that she might be holy and without blemish.  
So also husbands should love their wives as their own bodies.  
He who loves his wife loves himself.  
For no one hates his own flesh  
but rather nourishes and cherishes it,  
even as Christ does the church,  
because we are members of his body.  
*For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother*  
*and be joined to his wife,*  
*and the two shall become one flesh.*  
This is a great mystery,  
but I speak in reference to Christ and the church.

#### Gospel [John 6:60-69]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Many of Jesus' disciples who were listening said,  
"This saying is hard; who can accept it?"  
Since Jesus knew that his disciples were murmuring about this,  
he said to them, "Does this shock you?  
What if you were to see the Son of Man ascending  
to where he was before?  
It is the spirit that gives life,  
while the flesh is of no avail.  
The words I have spoken to you are Spirit and life.  
But there are some of you who do not believe."  
Jesus knew from the beginning the ones who would not believe  
and the one who would betray him.  
And he said,  
"For this reason I have told you that no one can come to me  
unless it is granted him by my Father."  

As a result of this,  
many of his disciples returned to their former way of life  
and no longer accompanied him.  
Jesus then said to the Twelve, "Do you also want to leave?"  
Simon Peter answered him, "Master, to whom shall we go?  
You have the words of eternal life.  
We have come to believe  
and are convinced that you are the Holy One of God."

#### First Reading [Isaiah 66:18-21]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Thus says the LORD:  
I know their works and their thoughts,  
and I come to gather nations of every language;  
they shall come and see my glory.  
I will set a sign among them;  
from them I will send fugitives to the nations:  
to Tarshish, Put and Lud, Mosoch, Tubal and Javan,  
to the distant coastlands  
that have never heard of my fame, or seen my glory;  
and they shall proclaim my glory among the nations.  
They shall bring all your brothers and sisters from all the nations  
as an offering to the LORD,  
on horses and in chariots, in carts, upon mules and dromedaries,  
to Jerusalem, my holy mountain, says the LORD,  
just as the Israelites bring their offering  
to the house of the LORD in clean vessels.  
Some of these I will take as priests and Levites, says the LORD.

**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia.**  

Praise the LORD, all you nations;  
glorify him, all you peoples! **[℟.]{.red}**  

For steadfast is his kindness toward us,  
and the fidelity of the LORD endures forever. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Hebrews 12:5-7, 11-13]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters,  
You have forgotten the exhortation addressed to you as children:  
"My son, do not disdain the discipline of the Lord  
or lose heart when reproved by him;  
for whom the Lord loves, he disciplines;  
he scourges every son he acknowledges."  
Endure your trials as "discipline";  
God treats you as sons.  
For what "son" is there whom his father does not discipline?  
At the time,  
all discipline seems a cause not for joy but for pain,  
yet later it brings the peaceful fruit of righteousness  
to those who are trained by it.  

So strengthen your drooping hands and your weak knees.  
Make straight paths for your feet,  
that what is lame may not be disjointed but healed.

no one comes to the Father, except through me. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Gospel [Luke 13:22-30]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus passed through towns and villages,  
teaching as he went and making his way to Jerusalem.  
Someone asked him,  
"Lord, will only a few people be saved?"  
He answered them,  
"Strive to enter through the narrow gate,  
for many, I tell you, will attempt to enter  
but will not be strong enough.  
After the master of the house has arisen and locked the door,  
then will you stand outside knocking and saying,  
'Lord, open the door for us.'  
He will say to you in reply,  
'I do not know where you are from.  
And you will say,  
'We ate and drank in your company and you taught in our streets.'  
Then he will say to you,  
'I do not know where you are from.  
Depart from me, all you evildoers!'  
And there will be wailing and grinding of teeth  
when you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob  
and all the prophets in the kingdom of God  
and you yourselves cast out.  
And people will come from the east and the west  
and from the north and the south  
and will recline at table in the kingdom of God.  
For behold, some are last who will be first,  
and some are first who will be last."
