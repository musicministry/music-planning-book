::: {.red}
#### First Reading [Jeremiah 20:7-9]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

You duped me, O LORD, and I let myself be duped;  
you were too strong for me, and you triumphed.  
All the day I am an object of laughter;  
everyone mocks me.  

Whenever I speak, I must cry out,  
violence and outrage is my message;  
the word of the LORD has brought me  
derision and reproach all the day.  

I say to myself, I will not mention him,  
I will speak in his name no more.  
But then it becomes like fire burning in my heart,  
imprisoned in my bones;  
I grow weary holding it in, I cannot endure it.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 63:2, 3-4, 5-6, 8-9]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **My soul is thirsting for you, O Lord my God.**  

O God, you are my God whom I seek;  
for you my flesh pines and my soul thirsts  
like the earth, parched, lifeless and without water. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Thus have I gazed toward you in the sanctuary  
to see your power and your glory,  
for your kindness is a greater good than life;  
my lips shall glorify you. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Thus will I bless you while I live;  
lifting up my hands, I will call upon your name.  
As with the riches of a banquet shall my soul be satisfied,  
and with exultant lips my mouth shall praise you. **[℟.]{.red}**  

You are my help,  
and in the shadow of your wings I shout for joy.  
My soul clings fast to you;  
your right hand upholds me. **[℟.]{.red}**  

***

::: {.red}
#### Second Reading [Romans 12:1-2]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

I urge you, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God,  
to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice,  
holy and pleasing to God, your spiritual worship.  
Do not conform yourselves to this age  
but be transformed by the renewal of your mind,  
that you may discern what is the will of God,  
what is good and pleasing and perfect.  

***

::: {.red}
#### Gospel Acclamation [cf. Ephesians 1:17-18]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia, alleluia.**  
May the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ  
enlighten the eyes of our hearts,  
that we may know what is the hope. 
that belongs to our call. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Gospel [Matthew 16:21-27]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus began to show his disciples  
that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer greatly  
from the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes,  
and be killed and on the third day be raised.  
Then Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him,  
"God forbid, Lord! No such thing shall ever happen to you."  
He turned and said to Peter,  
"Get behind me, Satan! You are an obstacle to me.  
You are thinking not as God does, but as human beings do."  

Then Jesus said to his disciples,  
"Whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself,  
take up his cross, and follow me.  
For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it,  
but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.  
What profit would there be for one to gain the whole world  
and forfeit his life?  
Or what can one give in exchange for his life?  
For the Son of Man will come with his angels in his Father's glory,  
and then he will repay all according to his conduct."

#### First Reading [Deuteronomy 4:1-2, 6-8]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Moses said to the people:  
"Now, Israel, hear the statutes and decrees  
which I am teaching you to observe,  
that you may live, and may enter in and take possession of the land  
which the LORD, the God of your fathers, is giving you.  
In your observance of the commandments of the LORD, your God,  
which I enjoin upon you,  
you shall not add to what I command you nor subtract from it.  
Observe them carefully,  
for thus will you give evidence  
of your wisdom and intelligence to the nations,  
who will hear of all these statutes and say,  
'This great nation is truly a wise and intelligent people.'  
For what great nation is there  
that has gods so close to it as the LORD, our God, is to us  
whenever we call upon him?  
Or what great nation has statutes and decrees  
that are as just as this whole law  
which I am setting before you today?"

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 15:2-3, 3-4, 4-5]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **The one who does justice will live in the presence of the Lord.**  

Whoever walks blamelessly and does justice;  
who thinks the truth in his heart  
and slanders not with his tongue. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Who harms not his fellow man,  
nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor;  
by whom the reprobate is despised,  
while he honors those who fear the LORD. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Who lends not his money at usury  
and accepts no bribe against the innocent.  
Whoever does these things  
shall never be disturbed. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [James 1:17-18, 21b-22, 27]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Dearest brothers and sisters:  
All good giving and every perfect gift is from above,  
coming down from the Father of lights,  
with whom there is no alteration or shadow caused by change.  
He willed to give us birth by the word of truth  
that we may be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.  

Humbly welcome the word that has been planted in you  
and is able to save your souls.  

Be doers of the word and not hearers only, deluding yourselves.  

Religion that is pure and undefiled before God and the Father is this:  
to care for orphans and widows in their affliction  
and to keep oneself unstained by the world.

#### Gospel [Mark 7:1-8, 14-15, 21-23]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

When the Pharisees with some scribes who had come from Jerusalem  
gathered around Jesus,  
they observed that some of his disciples ate their meals  
with unclean, that is, unwashed, hands.  
—For the Pharisees and, in fact, all Jews,  
do not eat without carefully washing their hands,  
keeping the tradition of the elders.  
And on coming from the marketplace  
they do not eat without purifying themselves.  
And there are many other things that they have traditionally observed,  
the purification of cups and jugs and kettles and beds.-  
So the Pharisees and scribes questioned him,  
"Why do your disciples not follow the tradition of the elders  
but instead eat a meal with unclean hands?"  
He responded,  
"Well did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites, as it is written:  
*This people honors me with their lips,*  
*but their hearts are far from me;*  
*in vain do they worship me,*  
*teaching as doctrines human precepts.*  
You disregard God's commandment but cling to human tradition."  

He summoned the crowd again and said to them,  
"Hear me, all of you, and understand.  
Nothing that enters one from outside can defile that person;  
but the things that come out from within are what defile.  

"From within people, from their hearts,  
come evil thoughts, unchastity, theft, murder,  
adultery, greed, malice, deceit,  
licentiousness, envy, blasphemy, arrogance, folly.  
All these evils come from within and they defile."

::: {.red}
#### First Reading [Sirach 3:17-18, 20, 28-29]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

My child, conduct your affairs with humility,  
 and you will be loved more than a giver of gifts.  
 Humble yourself the more, the greater you are,  
 and you will find favor with God.  
 What is too sublime for you, seek not,  
 into things beyond your strength search not.  
 The mind of a sage appreciates proverbs,  
 and an attentive ear is the joy of the wise.  
 Water quenches a flaming fire,  
 and alms atone for sins.  

***

::: {.red}
#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 68:4-5, 6-7, 10-11]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **God, in your goodness, you have made a home for the poor.**  

The just rejoice and exult before God;  
they are glad and rejoice.  
Sing to God, chant praise to his name;  
whose name is the LORD. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The father of orphans and the defender of widows  
is God in his holy dwelling.  
God gives a home to the forsaken;  
he leads forth prisoners to prosperity. **[℟.]{.red}**  

A bountiful rain you showered down, O God, upon your inheritance;  
you restored the land when it languished;  
your flock settled in it;  
in your goodness, O God, you provided it for the needy. **[℟.]{.red}**  

***

::: {.red}
#### Second Reading [Hebrews 12:18-19, 22-24a]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
You have not approached that which could be touched  
and a blazing fire and gloomy darkness  
and storm and a trumpet blast  
and a voice speaking words such that those who heard  
begged that no message be further addressed to them.  
No, you have approached Mount Zion  
and the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem,  
and countless angels in festal gathering,  
and the assembly of the firstborn enrolled in heaven,  
and God the judge of all,  
and the spirits of the just made perfect,  
and Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant,  
and the sprinkled blood that speaks more eloquently than that of Abel.  

***

::: {.red}
#### Gospel Acclamation [Matthew 11:29ab]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia, alleluia.**  
Take my yoke upon you, says the Lord,  
and learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart. **[℟.]{.red}**  

***

#### Gospel [Luke 14:1, 7-14]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

On a sabbath Jesus went to dine  
at the home of one of the leading Pharisees,  
and the people there were observing him carefully.  

He told a parable to those who had been invited,  
noticing how they were choosing the places of honor at the table.  
"When you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet,  
do not recline at table in the place of honor.  
A more distinguished guest than you may have been invited by him,  
and the host who invited both of you may approach you and say,  
'Give your place to this man,'  
and then you would proceed with embarrassment  
to take the lowest place.  
Rather, when you are invited,  
go and take the lowest place  
so that when the host comes to you he may say,  
'My friend, move up to a higher position.'  
Then you will enjoy the esteem of your companions at the table.  
For every one who exalts himself will be humbled,  
but the one who humbles himself will be exalted."  
Then he said to the host who invited him,  
"When you hold a lunch or a dinner,  
do not invite your friends or your brothers  
or your relatives or your wealthy neighbors,  
in case they may invite you back and you have repayment.  
Rather, when you hold a banquet,  
invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind;  
blessed indeed will you be because of their inability to repay you.  
For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous."
