### &nbsp; Year A

#### First Reading [Sirach 27:30—28:7]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Wrath and anger are hateful things,  
yet the sinner hugs them tight.  
The vengeful will suffer the LORD’s vengeance,  
for he remembers their sins in detail.  
Forgive your neighbor’s injustice;  
then when you pray, your own sins will be forgiven.  
Could anyone nourish anger against another  
and expect healing from the LORD?  
Could anyone refuse mercy to another like himself,  
can he seek pardon for his own sins?  
If one who is but flesh cherishes wrath,  
who will forgive his sins?  
Remember your last days, set enmity aside;  
remember death and decay, and cease from sin!  
Think of the commandments, hate not your neighbor;  
remember the Most High’s covenant, and overlook faults.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 103:1-2, 3-4, 9-10, 11-12]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **The Lord is kind and merciful, slow to anger, and rich in compassion.**  

Bless the LORD, O my soul;  
and all my being, bless his holy name.  
Bless the LORD, O my soul,  
and forget not all his benefits. **[℟.]{.red}**  

He pardons all your iniquities,  
heals all your ills.  
He redeems your life from destruction,  
crowns you with kindness and compassion. **[℟.]{.red}**  

He will not always chide,  
nor does he keep his wrath forever.  
Not according to our sins does he deal with us,  
nor does he requite us according to our crimes. **[℟.]{.red}**  

For as the heavens are high above the earth,  
so surpassing is his kindness toward those who fear him.  
As far as the east is from the west,  
so far has he put our transgressions from us. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Romans 14:7-9]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
None of us lives for oneself, and no one dies for oneself.  
For if we live, we live for the Lord,  
and if we die, we die for the Lord;  
so then, whether we live or die, we are the Lord’s.  
For this is why Christ died and came to life,  
that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.

#### Gospel Acclamation [John 13:34]{style="float:right" .small}

**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia, alleluia.**  
I give you a new commandment, says the Lord:  
love one another as I have loved you. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Gospel [Matthew 18:21-35]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Peter approached Jesus and asked him,  
“Lord, if my brother sins against me,  
how often must I forgive?  
As many as seven times?”   
Jesus answered, “I say to you, not seven times but seventy-seven times.  
That is why the kingdom of heaven may be likened to a king  
who decided to settle accounts with his servants.  
When he began the accounting,  
a debtor was brought before him who owed him a huge amount.  
Since he had no way of paying it back,  
his master ordered him to be sold,  
along with his wife, his children, and all his property,  
in payment of the debt.  
At that, the servant fell down, did him homage, and said,  
‘Be patient with me, and I will pay you back in full.’  
Moved with compassion the master of that servant  
let him go and forgave him the loan.  
When that servant had left, he found one of his fellow servants  
who owed him a much smaller amount.  
He seized him and started to choke him, demanding,  
‘Pay back what you owe.’  
Falling to his knees, his fellow servant begged him,  
‘Be patient with me, and I will pay you back.’  
But he refused.  
Instead, he had the fellow servant put in prison  
until he paid back the debt.  
Now when his fellow servants saw what had happened,  
they were deeply disturbed, and went to their master  
and reported the whole affair.  
His master summoned him and said to him, ‘You wicked servant!  
I forgave you your entire debt because you begged me to.  
Should you not have had pity on your fellow servant,  
as I had pity on you?’  
Then in anger his master handed him over to the torturers  
until he should pay back the whole debt.  
So will my heavenly Father do to you,  
unless each of you forgives your brother from your heart.”

### &nbsp; Year B

#### First Reading [Isaiah 50:5-9a]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

The Lord GOD opens my ear that I may hear;  
and I have not rebelled,  
have not turned back.  
I gave my back to those who beat me,  
my cheeks to those who plucked my beard;  
my face I did not shield  
from buffets and spitting.  

The Lord GOD is my help,  
therefore I am not disgraced;  
I have set my face like flint,  
knowing that I shall not be put to shame.  
He is near who upholds my right;  
if anyone wishes to oppose me,  
let us appear together.  
Who disputes my right?  
Let that man confront me.  
See, the Lord GOD is my help;  
who will prove me wrong?

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 116:1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 8-9]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **I will walk before the Lord, in the land of the living.**  
[Or:]{.red}  
**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia.**  

I love the LORD because he has heard  
my voice in supplication,  
because he has inclined his ear to me  
the day I called. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The cords of death encompassed me;  
the snares of the netherworld seized upon me;  
I fell into distress and sorrow,  
and I called upon the name of the LORD,  
"O LORD, save my life!" **[℟.]{.red}**  

Gracious is the LORD and just;  
yes, our God is merciful.  
The LORD keeps the little ones;  
I was brought low, and he saved me. **[℟.]{.red}**  

For he has freed my soul from death,  
my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling.  
I shall walk before the Lord  
in the land of the living. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [James 2:14-18]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

What good is it, my brothers and sisters,  
if someone says he has faith but does not have works?  
Can that faith save him?  
If a brother or sister has nothing to wear  
and has no food for the day,  
and one of you says to them,  
"Go in peace, keep warm, and eat well,"  
but you do not give them the necessities of the body,  
what good is it?  
So also faith of itself,  
if it does not have works, is dead.  

Indeed someone might say,  
"You have faith and I have works."  
Demonstrate your faith to me without works,  
and I will demonstrate my faith to you from my works.

#### Gospel Acclamation [Galatians 6:14]{style="float:right" .small}

through which the world has been crucified to me and I to the world. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Gospel [Mark 8:27-35]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus and his disciples set out  
for the villages of Caesarea Philippi.  
Along the way he asked his disciples,  
"Who do people say that I am?"  
They said in reply,  
"John the Baptist, others Elijah,  
still others one of the prophets."  
And he asked them,  
"But who do you say that I am?"  
Peter said to him in reply,  
"You are the Christ."  
Then he warned them not to tell anyone about him.  

He began to teach them  
that the Son of Man must suffer greatly  
and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes,  
and be killed, and rise after three days.  
He spoke this openly.  
Then Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.  
At this he turned around and, looking at his disciples,  
rebuked Peter and said, "Get behind me, Satan.  
You are thinking not as God does, but as human beings do."  

He summoned the crowd with his disciples and said to them,  
"Whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself,  
take up his cross, and follow me.  
For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it,  
but whoever loses his life for my sake  
and that of the gospel will save it."

### &nbsp; Year C

#### First Reading [Exodus 32:7-11, 13-14]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

The LORD said to Moses,  
"Go down at once to your people,  
whom you brought out of the land of Egypt,  
for they have become depraved.  
They have soon turned aside from the way I pointed out to them,  
making for themselves a molten calf and worshiping it,  
sacrificing to it and crying out,  
'This is your God, O Israel,  
who brought you out of the land of Egypt!'  
"I see how stiff-necked this people is," continued the LORD to Moses.  
"Let me alone, then,  
that my wrath may blaze up against them to consume them.  
Then I will make of you a great nation."  

But Moses implored the LORD, his God, saying,  
"Why, O LORD, should your wrath blaze up against your own people,  
whom you brought out of the land of Egypt  
with such great power and with so strong a hand?  
Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,  
and how you swore to them by your own self, saying,  
'I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky;  
and all this land that I promised,  
I will give your descendants as their perpetual heritage.'"  
So the LORD relented in the punishment  
he had threatened to inflict on his people.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Ps 51:3-4, 12-13, 17, 19; Luke 15:18]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **I will rise and go to my father.**  

Have mercy on me, O God, in your goodness;  
in the greatness of your compassion wipe out my offense.  
Thoroughly wash me from my guilt  
and of my sin cleanse me. **[℟.]{.red}**  

A clean heart create for me, O God,  
and a steadfast spirit renew within me.  
Cast me not out from your presence,  
and your Holy Spirit take not from me. **[℟.]{.red}**  

O Lord, open my lips,  
and my mouth shall proclaim your praise.  
My sacrifice, O God, is a contrite spirit;  
a heart contrite and humbled, O God, you will not spurn. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [1 Timothy 1:12-17]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Beloved:  
I am grateful to him who has strengthened me, Christ Jesus our Lord,  
because he considered me trustworthy  
in appointing me to the ministry.  
I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and arrogant,  
but I have been mercifully treated  
because I acted out of ignorance in my unbelief.  
Indeed, the grace of our Lord has been abundant,  
along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.  
This saying is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance:  
Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.  
Of these I am the foremost.  
But for that reason I was mercifully treated,  
so that in me, as the foremost,  
Christ Jesus might display all his patience as an example  
for those who would come to believe in him for everlasting life.  
To the king of ages, incorruptible, invisible, the only God,  
honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.

#### Gospel [Luke 15:1-32 or 15:1-10]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to listen to Jesus,  
but the Pharisees and scribes began to complain, saying,  
“This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”  
So to them he addressed this parable.  
“What man among you having a hundred sheep and losing one of them  
would not leave the ninety-nine in the desert  
and go after the lost one until he finds it?  
And when he does find it,  
he sets it on his shoulders with great joy  
and, upon his arrival home,  
he calls together his friends and neighbors and says to them,  
‘Rejoice with me because I have found my lost sheep.’  
I tell you, in just the same way  
there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents  
than over ninety-nine righteous people  
who have no need of repentance.  

“Or what woman having ten coins and losing one  
would not light a lamp and sweep the house,  
searching carefully until she finds it?  
And when she does find it,  
she calls together her friends and neighbors  
and says to them,  
‘Rejoice with me because I have found the coin that I lost.’  
In just the same way, I tell you,  
there will be rejoicing among the angels of God  
over one sinner who repents.”  

Then he said,  
“A man had two sons, and the younger son said to his father,  
‘Father give me the share of your estate that should come to me.’  
So the father divided the property between them.  
After a few days, the younger son collected all his belongings  
and set off to a distant country  
where he squandered his inheritance on a life of dissipation.  
When he had freely spent everything,  
a severe famine struck that country,  
and he found himself in dire need.  
So he hired himself out to one of the local citizens  
who sent him to his farm to tend the swine.  
And he longed to eat his fill of the pods on which the swine fed,  
but nobody gave him any.  
Coming to his senses he thought,  
‘How many of my father’s hired workers  
have more than enough food to eat,  
but here am I, dying from hunger.  
I shall get up and go to my father and I shall say to him,  
“Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.  
I no longer deserve to be called your son;  
treat me as you would treat one of your hired workers.”’  
So he got up and went back to his father.  
While he was still a long way off,  
his father caught sight of him,  
and was filled with compassion.  
He ran to his son, embraced him and kissed him.  
His son said to him,  
‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you;  
I no longer deserve to be called your son.’  
But his father ordered his servants,  
‘Quickly bring the finest robe and put it on him;  
put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.  
Take the fattened calf and slaughter it.  
Then let us celebrate with a feast,  
because this son of mine was dead, and has come to life again;  
he was lost, and has been found.’  
Then the celebration began.  
Now the older son had been out in the field  
and, on his way back, as he neared the house,  
he heard the sound of music and dancing.  
He called one of the servants and asked what this might mean.  
The servant said to him,  
‘Your brother has returned  
and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf  
because he has him back safe and sound.’  
He became angry,  
and when he refused to enter the house,  
his father came out and pleaded with him.  
He said to his father in reply,  
‘Look, all these years I served you  
and not once did I disobey your orders;  
yet you never gave me even a young goat to feast on with my friends.  But when your son returns,  
who swallowed up your property with prostitutes,  
for him you slaughter the fattened calf.’  
He said to him,  
‘My son, you are here with me always;  
everything I have is yours.  
But now we must celebrate and rejoice,  
because your brother was dead and has come to life again;  
he was lost and has been found.’”
