#### First Reading [2 Kings 4:8-11, 14-16a]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

One day Elisha came to Shunem,  
where there was a woman of influence, who urged him to dine with her.  
Afterward, whenever he passed by, he used to stop there to dine.  
So she said to her husband, “I know that Elisha is a holy man of God.  
Since he visits us often, let us arrange a little room on the roof  
and furnish it for him with a bed, table, chair, and lamp,  
so that when he comes to us he can stay there.”  
Sometime later Elisha arrived and stayed in the room overnight.  
Elisha asked, “Can something be done for her?”  
His servant Gehazi answered, “Yes!  
She has no son, and her husband is getting on in years.”  
Elisha said, “Call her.”  
When the woman had been called and stood at the door,  
Elisha promised, “This time next year  
you will be fondling a baby son.”

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 89:2-3, 16-17, 18-19]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Forever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.**  

The promises of the LORD I will sing forever,  
through all generations my mouth shall proclaim your faithfulness.  
For you have said, “My kindness is established forever;”  
in heaven you have confirmed your faithfulness. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Blessed the people who know the joyful shout;  
in the light of your countenance, O LORD, they walk.  
At your name they rejoice all the day,  
and through your justice they are exalted. **[℟.]{.red}**  

You are the splendor of their strength,  
and by your favor our horn is exalted.  
For to the LORD belongs our shield,  
and the Holy One of Israel, our king. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Romans 6:3-4, 8-11]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
Are you unaware that we who were baptized into Christ Jesus  
were baptized into his death?  
We were indeed buried with him through baptism into death,  
so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead  
by the glory of the Father,  
we too might live in newness of life.If, then, we have died with Christ,  
we believe that we shall also live with him.  
We know that Christ, raised from the dead, dies no more;  
death no longer has power over him.  
As to his death, he died to sin once and for all;  
as to his life, he lives for God.  
Consequently, you too must think of yourselves as dead to sin  
and living for God in Christ Jesus.

#### Gospel Acclamation [1 Peter 2:19]{style="float:right" .small}

**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia, alleluia.**  
You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation;  
announce the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Gospel [Matthew 10:37-42]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus said to his apostles:  
“Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me,  
and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me;  
and whoever does not take up his cross  
and follow after me is not worthy of me.  
Whoever finds his life will lose it,  
and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."  
"Whoever receives you receives me,  
and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.  
Whoever receives a prophet because he is a prophet  
will receive a prophet’s reward,  
and whoever receives a righteous man  
because he is a righteous man  
will receive a righteous man’s reward.  
And whoever gives only a cup of cold water  
to one of these little ones to drink  
because the little one is a disciple—  
amen, I say to you, he will surely not lose his reward.”

### &nbsp; Year B
:::

::: {.red}
#### First Reading [Wisdom 1:13-15; 2:23-24]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

God did not make death,  
nor does he rejoice in the destruction of the living.  
For he fashioned all things that they might have being;  
and the creatures of the world are wholesome,  
and there is not a destructive drug among them  
nor any domain of the netherworld on earth,  
for justice is undying.  
For God formed man to be imperishable;  
the image of his own nature he made him.  
But by the envy of the devil, death entered the world,  
and they who belong to his company experience it.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 30:2, 4, 5-6, 11, 12, 13]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **I will praise you, Lord, for you have rescued me.**  

VI will extol you, O LORD, for you drew me clear  
and did not let my enemies rejoice over me.  
O LORD, you brought me up from the netherworld;  
you preserved me from among those going down into the pit. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Sing praise to the LORD, you his faithful ones,  
and give thanks to his holy name.  
For his anger lasts but a moment;  
a lifetime, his good will.  
At nightfall, weeping enters in,  
but with the dawn, rejoicing. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Hear, O LORD, and have pity on me;  
O LORD, be my helper.  
You changed my mourning into dancing;  
O LORD, my God, forever will I give you thanks. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [2 Corinthians 8:7, 9, 13-15]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
As you excel in every respect, in faith, discourse,  
knowledge, all earnestness, and in the love we have for you,  
may you excel in this gracious act also.  

For you know the gracious act of our Lord Jesus Christ,  
that though he was rich, for your sake he became poor,  
so that by his poverty you might become rich.  
Not that others should have relief while you are burdened,  
but that as a matter of equality  
your abundance at the present time should supply their needs,  
so that their abundance may also supply your needs,  
that there may be equality.  
As it is written:  
*Whoever had much did not have more,*  
*and whoever had little did not have less.*

#### Gospel [Mark 5:21-43 or 5:21-24, 35b-43]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

When Jesus had crossed again in the boat  
to the other side,  
a large crowd gathered around him, and he stayed close to the sea.  
One of the synagogue officials, named Jairus, came forward.  
Seeing him he fell at his feet and pleaded earnestly with him, saying,  
"My daughter is at the point of death.  
Please, come lay your hands on her  
that she may get well and live."  
He went off with him,  
and a large crowd followed him and pressed upon him.  

There was a woman afflicted with hemorrhages for twelve years.  
She had suffered greatly at the hands of many doctors  
and had spent all that she had.  
Yet she was not helped but only grew worse.  
She had heard about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak.  
She said, "If I but touch his clothes, I shall be cured."  
Immediately her flow of blood dried up.  
She felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.  
Jesus, aware at once that power had gone out from him,  
turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who has touched my clothes?"  
But his disciples said to Jesus,  
"You see how the crowd is pressing upon you,  
and yet you ask, 'Who touched me?'"  
And he looked around to see who had done it.  
The woman, realizing what had happened to her,  
approached in fear and trembling.  
She fell down before Jesus and told him the whole truth.  
He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has saved you.  
Go in peace and be cured of your affliction."  

While he was still speaking,  
people from the synagogue official's house arrived and said,  
"Your daughter has died; why trouble the teacher any longer?"  
Disregarding the message that was reported,  
Jesus said to the synagogue official,  
"Do not be afraid; just have faith."  
He did not allow anyone to accompany him inside  
except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.  
When they arrived at the house of the synagogue official,  
he caught sight of a commotion,  
people weeping and wailing loudly.  
So he went in and said to them,  
"Why this commotion and weeping?  
The child is not dead but asleep."  
And they ridiculed him.  
Then he put them all out.  
He took along the child's father and mother  
and those who were with him  
and entered the room where the child was.  
He took the child by the hand and said to her, "*Talitha koum*,"  
which means, "Little girl, I say to you, arise!"  
The girl, a child of twelve, arose immediately and walked around.  
At that they were utterly astounded.  
He gave strict orders that no one should know this  
and said that she should be given something to eat.

#### First Reading [1 Kings 19:16b, 19-21]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

The LORD said to Elijah:  
“You shall anoint Elisha, son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah,  
as prophet to succeed you.”  

Elijah set out and came upon Elisha, son of Shaphat,  
as he was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen;  
he was following the twelfth.  
Elijah went over to him and threw his cloak over him.  
Elisha left the oxen, ran after Elijah, and said,  
“Please, let me kiss my father and mother goodbye,  
and I will follow you.”  
Elijah answered, “Go back!  
Have I done anything to you?”  
Elisha left him, and taking the yoke of oxen, slaughtered them;  
he used the plowing equipment for fuel to boil their flesh,  
and gave it to his people to eat.  
Then Elisha left and followed Elijah as his attendant.

:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **You are my inheritance, O Lord.**  

Keep me, O God, for in you I take refuge;  
&emsp; I say to the LORD, “My Lord are you.  
O LORD, my allotted portion and my cup,  
&emsp; you it is who hold fast my lot.” **[℟.]{.red}**  

I bless the LORD who counsels me;  
&emsp; even in the night my heart exhorts me.  
I set the LORD ever before me;  
&emsp; with him at my right hand I shall not be disturbed. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Therefore my heart is glad and my soul rejoices,  
&emsp; my body, too, abides in confidence  
because you will not abandon my soul to the netherworld,  
&emsp; nor will you suffer your faithful one to undergo corruption. **[℟.]{.red}**  

You will show me the path to life,  
&emsp; fullness of joys in your presence,  
&emsp; the delights at your right hand forever. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Galatians 5:1, 13-18]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
For freedom Christ set us free;  
so stand firm and do not submit again to the yoke of slavery.  

For you were called for freedom, brothers and sisters.  
But do not use this freedom  
as an opportunity for the flesh;  
rather, serve one another through love.  
For the whole law is fulfilled in one statement,  
namely, *You shall love your neighbor as yourself.*  
But if you go on biting and devouring one another,  
beware that you are not consumed by one another.  

I say, then: live by the Spirit  
and you will certainly not gratify the desire of the flesh.  
For the flesh has desires against the Spirit,  
and the Spirit against the flesh;  
these are opposed to each other,  
so that you may not do what you want.  
But if you are guided by the Spirit, you are not under the law.

#### Gospel [Luke 9:51-62]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

When the days for Jesus’ being taken up were fulfilled,  
he resolutely determined to journey to Jerusalem,  
and he sent messengers ahead of him.  
On the way they entered a Samaritan village  
to prepare for his reception there,  
but they would not welcome him  
because the destination of his journey was Jerusalem.  
When the disciples James and John saw this they asked,  
“Lord, do you want us to call down fire from heaven
to consume them?”  
Jesus turned and rebuked them, and they journeyed to another village.  

As they were proceeding on their journey someone said to him,  
“I will follow you wherever you go.”  
Jesus answered him,  
“Foxes have dens and birds of the sky have nests,  
but the Son of Man has nowhere to rest his head.”  

And to another he said, “Follow me.”  
But he replied, “Lord, let me go first and bury my father.”  
But he answered him, “Let the dead bury their dead.  
But you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God.”  
And another said, “I will follow you, Lord,  
but first let me say farewell to my family at home.”  
To him Jesus said, “No one who sets a hand to the plow  
and looks to what was left behind is fit for the kingdom of God.”
