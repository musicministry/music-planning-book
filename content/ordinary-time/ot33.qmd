#### First Reading [Proverbs 31:10-13, 19-20, 30-31]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

When one finds a worthy wife,  
her value is far beyond pearls.  
Her husband, entrusting his heart to her,  
has an unfailing prize.  
She brings him good, and not evil,  
all the days of her life.  
She obtains wool and flax  
and works with loving hands.  
She puts her hands to the distaff,  
and her fingers ply the spindle.  
She reaches out her hands to the poor,  
and extends her arms to the needy.  
Charm is deceptive and beauty fleeting;  
the woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.  
Give her a reward for her labors,  
and let her works praise her at the city gates.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 128:1-2, 3, 4-5]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Blessed are those who fear the Lord.**  

Blessed are you who fear the LORD,  
who walk in his ways!  
For you shall eat the fruit of your handiwork;  
blessed shall you be, and favored. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine  
in the recesses of your home;  
Your children like olive plants  
around your table. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Behold, thus is the man blessed  
who fears the LORD.  
The LORD bless you from Zion:  
may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem  
all the days of your life. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [1 Thessalonians 5:1-6]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Concerning times and seasons, brothers and sisters,  
you have no need for anything to be written to you.  
For you yourselves know very well that the day of the Lord will come
like a thief at night.  
When people are saying, "Peace and security,"  
then sudden disaster comes upon them,   
like labor pains upon a pregnant woman,  
and they will not escape.  

But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness,  
for that day to overtake you like a thief.  
For all of you are children of the light  
and children of the day.  
We are not of the night or of darkness.  
Therefore, let us not sleep as the rest do,  
but let us stay alert and sober.

Whoever remains in me bears much fruit. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Gospel [Matthew 25:14-30 or 25:14-15, 19-21]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus told his disciples this parable:  
"A man going on a journey  
called in his servants and entrusted his possessions to them.  
To one he gave five talents; to another, two; to a third, one--  
to each according to his ability.  
Then he went away.  
Immediately the one who received five talents went and traded with them,  
and made another five.  
Likewise, the one who received two made another two.  
But the man who received one went off and dug a hole in the ground  
and buried his master's money.  

"After a long time  
the master of those servants came back  
and settled accounts with them.  
The one who had received five talents came forward  
bringing the additional five.  
He said, 'Master, you gave me five talents.  
See, I have made five more.'  
His master said to him, 'Well done, my good and faithful servant.  
Since you were faithful in small matters,  
I will give you great responsibilities.  
Come, share your master's joy.'  
Then the one who had received two talents also came forward and said,  
'Master, you gave me two talents.  
See, I have made two more.'  
His master said to him, 'Well done, my good and faithful servant.  
Since you were faithful in small matters,  
I will give you great responsibilities.  
Come, share your master's joy.'  
Then the one who had received the one talent came forward and said,  
'Master, I knew you were a demanding person,  
harvesting where you did not plant  
and gathering where you did not scatter;  
so out of fear I went off and buried your talent in the ground.  
Here it is back.'  
His master said to him in reply, 'You wicked, lazy servant!  
So you knew that I harvest where I did not plant  
and gather where I did not scatter?  
Should you not then have put my money in the bank  
so that I could have got it back with interest on my return?  
Now then! Take the talent from him and give it to the one with ten.  
For to everyone who has,  
more will be given and he will grow rich;  
but from the one who has not,  
even what he has will be taken away.  
And throw this useless servant into the darkness outside,  
where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.'"

#### First Reading [Daniel 12:1-3]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

In those days, I Daniel,  
&emsp; heard this word of the Lord:  
"At that time there shall arise  
&emsp; Michael, the great prince,  
&emsp; guardian of your people;  
it shall be a time unsurpassed in distress  
&emsp; since nations began until that time.  
At that time your people shall escape,  
&emsp; everyone who is found written in the book.  

“Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake;  
&emsp; some shall live forever,  
&emsp; others shall be an everlasting horror and disgrace.  

“But the wise shall shine brightly  
&emsp; like the splendor of the firmament,  
and those who lead the many to justice  
&emsp; shall be like the stars forever."

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 16:5, 8, 9-10, 11]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **You are my inheritance, O Lord!**  

O LORD, my allotted portion and my cup,  
&emsp; you it is who hold fast my lot.  
I set the LORD ever before me;  
&emsp; with him at my right hand I shall not be disturbed. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Therefore my heart is glad and my soul rejoices,  
&emsp; my body, too, abides in confidence;  
because you will not abandon my soul to the netherworld,  
&emsp; nor will you suffer your faithful one to undergo corruption. **[℟.]{.red}**  

You will show me the path to life,  
&emsp; fullness of joys in your presence,  
&emsp; the delights at your right hand forever. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Hebrews 10:11-14, 18]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
Every priest stands daily at his ministry,  
offering frequently those same sacrifices  
that can never take away sins.  
But this one offered one sacrifice for sins,  
and took his seat forever at the right hand of God;  
now he waits until his enemies are made his footstool.  
For by one offering  
he has made perfect forever those who are being consecrated.  

Where there is forgiveness of these,  
there is no longer offering for sin.

**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia, alleluia.**  
Be vigilant at all times  
and pray that you have the strength to stand before the Son of Man. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Gospel [Mark 13:24-32]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus said to his disciples:  
"In those days after that tribulation  
the sun will be darkened,  
and the moon will not give its light,  
and the stars will be falling from the sky,  
and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.  

"And then they will see 'the Son of Man coming in the clouds'  
with great power and glory,  
and then he will send out the angels  
and gather his elect from the four winds,  
from the end of the earth to the end of the sky.  

"Learn a lesson from the fig tree.  
When its branch becomes tender and sprouts leaves,  
you know that summer is near.  
In the same way, when you see these things happening,  
know that he is near, at the gates.  
Amen, I say to you,  
this generation will not pass away  
until all these things have taken place.  
Heaven and earth will pass away,  
but my words will not pass away.  

"But of that day or hour, no one knows,  
neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father."

#### First Reading [Malachi 3:19-20a]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Lo, the day is coming, blazing like an oven,  
when all the proud and all evildoers will be stubble,  
and the day that is coming will set them on fire,  
leaving them neither root nor branch,  
says the LORD of hosts.  
But for you who fear my name, there will arise  
the sun of justice with its healing rays.

**[℟.]{.red}** **The Lord comes to rule the earth with justice.**  

Sing praise to the LORD with the harp,  
with the harp and melodious song.  
With trumpets and the sound of the horn  
sing joyfully before the King, the LORD. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Let the sea and what fills it resound,  
the world and those who dwell in it;  
let the rivers clap their hands,  
the mountains shout with them for joy. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Before the LORD, for he comes,  
for he comes to rule the earth,  
he will rule the world with justice  
and the peoples with equity. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [2 Thessalonians 3:7-12]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
You know how one must imitate us.  
For we did not act in a disorderly way among you,  
nor did we eat food received free from anyone.  
On the contrary, in toil and drudgery, night and day  
we worked, so as not to burden any of you.  
Not that we do not have the right.  
Rather, we wanted to present ourselves as a model for you,  
so that you might imitate us.  
In fact, when we were with you,  
we instructed you that if anyone was unwilling to work,  
neither should that one eat.  
We hear that some are conducting themselves among you in a
disorderly way,  
by not keeping busy but minding the business of others.  
Such people we instruct and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly  
and to eat their own food.

#### Gospel [Luke 21:5-19]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

While some people were speaking about  
how the temple was adorned with costly stones and votive offerings,  
Jesus said, "All that you see here--  
the days will come when there will not be left  
a stone upon another stone that will not be thrown down."  

Then they asked him,  
"Teacher, when will this happen?  
And what sign will there be when all these things are about to happen?"  
He answered,  
"See that you not be deceived,  
for many will come in my name, saying,  
'I am he,' and 'The time has come.'  
Do not follow them!  
When you hear of wars and insurrections,  
do not be terrified; for such things must happen first,  
but it will not immediately be the end."  
Then he said to them,  
"Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.  
There will be powerful earthquakes, famines, and plagues  
from place to place;  
and awesome sights and mighty signs will come from the sky.  

"Before all this happens, however,  
they will seize and persecute you,  
they will hand you over to the synagogues and to prisons,  
and they will have you led before kings and governors
because of my name.  
It will lead to your giving testimony.  
Remember, you are not to prepare your defense beforehand,  
for I myself shall give you a wisdom in speaking  
that all your adversaries will be powerless to resist or refute.  
You will even be handed over by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends,  
and they will put some of you to death.  
You will be hated by all because of my name,  
but not a hair on your head will be destroyed.  
By your perseverance you will secure your lives."
