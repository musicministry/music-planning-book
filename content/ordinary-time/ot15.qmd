### &nbsp; Year A

#### First Reading [Isaiah 55:10-11]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Thus says the LORD:  
Just as from the heavens  
the rain and snow come down  
and do not return there  
till they have watered the earth,  
making it fertile and fruitful,  
giving seed to the one who sows  
and bread to the one who eats,  
so shall my word be  
that goes forth from my mouth;  
my word shall not return to me void,  
but shall do my will,  
achieving the end for which I sent it.  

***

::: {.red}
#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 65:10, 11, 12-13, 14]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **The seed that falls on good ground will yield a fruitful harvest.**  

You have visited the land and watered it;  
greatly have you enriched it.  
God's watercourses are filled;  
you have prepared the grain. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Thus have you prepared the land: drenching its furrows,  
breaking up its clods,  
Softening it with showers,  
blessing its yield. **[℟.]{.red}**  

You have crowned the year with your bounty,  
and your paths overflow with a rich harvest;  
The untilled meadows overflow with it,  
and rejoicing clothes the hills. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The fields are garmented with flocks  
and the valleys blanketed with grain.  
They shout and sing for joy. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Romans 8:18-23]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
I consider that the sufferings of this present time are as nothing  
compared with the glory to be revealed for us.  
For creation awaits with eager expectation  
the revelation of the children of God;  
for creation was made subject to futility,  
not of its own accord but because of the one who subjected it,  
in hope that creation itself  
would be set free from slavery to corruption  
and share in the glorious freedom of the children of God.  
We know that all creation is groaning in labor pains even until now;  
and not only that, but we ourselves,  
who have the firstfruits of the Spirit,  
we also groan within ourselves  
as we wait for adoption, the redemption of our bodies.

#### Gospel Acclamation [See Luke 8:11]{style="float:right" .small}

**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia, alleluia.**  
The seed is the word of God, Christ is the sower.  
All who come to him will have life forever. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Gospel [Matthew 13:1-23 or 13:1-9]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

On that day, Jesus went out of the house and sat down by the sea.  
Such large crowds gathered around him  
that he got into a boat and sat down,  
and the whole crowd stood along the shore.  
And he spoke to them at length in parables, saying:  
"A sower went out to sow.  
And as he sowed, some seed fell on the path,  
and birds came and ate it up.  
Some fell on rocky ground, where it had little soil.  
It sprang up at once because the soil was not deep,  
and when the sun rose it was scorched,  
and it withered for lack of roots.  
Some seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it.  
But some seed fell on rich soil, and produced fruit,  
a hundred or sixty or thirtyfold.  
Whoever has ears ought to hear."  

The disciples approached him and said,  
"Why do you speak to them in parables?"  
He said to them in reply,  
"Because knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven  
has been granted to you, but to them it has not been granted.  
To anyone who has, more will be given and he will grow rich;  
from anyone who has not, even what he has will be taken away.  
This is why I speak to them in parables, because  
they look but do not see and hear but do not listen or understand.  
Isaiah's prophecy is fulfilled in them, which says:  
You shall indeed hear but not understand,  
you shall indeed look but never see.  
Gross is the heart of this people,  
they will hardly hear with their ears,  
they have closed their eyes,  
lest they see with their eyes  
and hear with their ears  
and understand with their hearts and be converted,  
and I heal them.  

"But blessed are your eyes, because they see,  
and your ears, because they hear.  
Amen, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people  
longed to see what you see but did not see it,  
and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.  

"Hear then the parable of the sower.  
The seed sown on the path is the one  
who hears the word of the kingdom without understanding it,  
and the evil one comes and steals away  
what was sown in his heart.  
The seed sown on rocky ground  
is the one who hears the word and receives it at once with joy.  
But he has no root and lasts only for a time.  
When some tribulation or persecution comes because of the word,  
he immediately falls away.  
The seed sown among thorns is the one who hears the word,  
but then worldly anxiety and the lure of riches choke the word  
and it bears no fruit.  
But the seed sown on rich soil  
is the one who hears the word and understands it,  
who indeed bears fruit and yields a hundred or sixty or thirtyfold."

### &nbsp; Year B

#### First Reading [Amos 7:12-15]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Amaziah, priest of Bethel, said to Amos,  
“Off with you, visionary, flee to the land of Judah!  
There earn your bread by prophesying,  
but never again prophesy in Bethel;  
for it is the king’s sanctuary and a royal temple.”  
Amos answered Amaziah, “I was no prophet,  
nor have I belonged to a company of prophets;  
I was a shepherd and a dresser of sycamores.  
The LORD took me from following the flock, and said to me,  
Go, prophesy to my people Israel.”

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 85:9-10, 11-12, 13-14]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Lord, let us see your kindness, and grant us your salvation.**  

I will hear what God proclaims;  
&emsp; the LORD —for he proclaims peace.  
Near indeed is his salvation to those who fear him,  
&emsp; glory dwelling in our land. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Kindness and truth shall meet;  
&emsp; justice and peace shall kiss.  
Truth shall spring out of the earth,  
&emsp; and justice shall look down from heaven. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The LORD himself will give his benefits;  
&emsp; our land shall yield its increase.  
Justice shall walk before him,  
&emsp; and prepare the way of his steps. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Eph 1:3-14 or 1:3-10]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,  
who has blessed us in Christ  
with every spiritual blessing in the heavens,  
as he chose us in him, before the foundation of the world,  
to be holy and without blemish before him.  
In love he destined us for adoption to himself through Jesus Christ,  
in accord with the favor of his will,  
for the praise of the glory of his grace  
that he granted us in the beloved.  
In him we have redemption by his blood,  
the forgiveness of transgressions,  
in accord with the riches of his grace that he lavished upon us.  
In all wisdom and insight, he has made known to us  
the mystery of his will in accord with his favor  
that he set forth in him as a plan for the fullness of times,  
to sum up all things in Christ, in heaven and on earth.  

In him we were also chosen,  
destined in accord with the purpose of the One  
who accomplishes all things according to the intention of his will,  
so that we might exist for the praise of his glory,  
we who first hoped in Christ.   
In him you also, who have heard the word of truth,  
the gospel of your salvation, and have believed in him,  
were sealed with the promised holy Spirit,  
which is the first installment of our inheritance  
toward redemption as God’s possession, to the praise of his glory.

#### Gospel [Mark 6:7-13]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus summoned the Twelve and began to send them out two by two  
and gave them authority over unclean spirits.  
He instructed them to take nothing for the journey  
but a walking stick—  
no food, no sack, no money in their belts.  
They were, however, to wear sandals  
but not a second tunic.  
He said to them,  
“Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave.  
Whatever place does not welcome you or listen to you,  
leave there and shake the dust off your feet  
in testimony against them.”  
So they went off and preached repentance.  
The Twelve drove out many demons,  
and they anointed with oil many who were sick and cured them.

#### First Reading [Deuteronomy 30:10-14]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Moses said to the people:  
"If only you would heed the voice of the LORD, your God,  
and keep his commandments and statutes  
that are written in this book of the law,  
when you return to the LORD, your God,  
with all your heart and all your soul.  

"For this command that I enjoin on you today  
is not too mysterious and remote for you.  
It is not up in the sky, that you should say,  
'Who will go up in the sky to get it for us  
and tell us of it, that we may carry it out?'  
Nor is it across the sea, that you should say,  
'Who will cross the sea to get it for us  
and tell us of it, that we may carry it out?'  
No, it is something very near to you,  
already in your mouths and in your hearts;  
you have only to carry it out."

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 69:14, 17, 30-31, 33-34, 36, 37]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Turn to the Lord in your need, and you will live.**  

I pray to you, O LORD,  
for the time of your favor, O God!  
In your great kindness answer me  
with your constant help.  
Answer me, O LORD, for bounteous is your kindness:  
in your great mercy turn toward me. **[℟.]{.red}**  

I am afflicted and in pain;  
let your saving help, O God, protect me.  
I will praise the name of God in song,  
and I will glorify him with thanksgiving. **[℟.]{.red}**  

"See, you lowly ones, and be glad;  
you who seek God, may your hearts revive!  
For the LORD hears the poor,  
and his own who are in bonds he spurns not." **[℟.]{.red}**  

For God will save Zion  
and rebuild the cities of Judah.  
The descendants of his servants shall inherit it,  
and those who love his name shall inhabit it. **[℟.]{.red}**  

[Or:]{.red} [Psalm 19:8, 9, 10, 11]{style="float:right" .small .red}

**[℟.]{.red}** **Your words, Lord, are Spirit and life.**  

The law of the LORD is perfect,  
refreshing the soul;  
the decree of the LORD is trustworthy,  
giving wisdom to the simple. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The precepts of the LORD are right,  
rejoicing the heart;  
the command of the LORD is clear,  
enlightening the eye. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The fear of the LORD is pure,  
enduring forever;  
the ordinances of the LORD are true,  
all of them just. **[℟.]{.red}**  

They are more precious than gold,  
than a heap of purest gold;  
sweeter also than syrup  
or honey from the comb. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Colossians 1:15-20]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Christ Jesus is the image of the invisible God,  
the firstborn of all creation.  
For in him were created all things in heaven and on earth,  
the visible and the invisible,  
whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers;  
all things were created through him and for him.  
He is before all things,  
and in him all things hold together.  
He is the head of the body, the church.  
He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead,  
that in all things he himself might be preeminent.  
For in him all the fullness was pleased to dwell,  
and through him to reconcile all things for him,  
making peace by the blood of his cross  
through him, whether those on earth or those in heaven.

#### Gospel [Luke 10:25-37]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

There was a scholar of the law who stood up to test Jesus and said,  
"Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"  
Jesus said to him, "What is written in the law?  
How do you read it?"  
He said in reply,  
"*You shall love the Lord, your God,*  
*with all your heart,*  
*with all your being,*  
*with all your strength,*  
*and with all your mind,*  
*and your neighbor as yourself.*"  
He replied to him, "You have answered correctly;  
do this and you will live."  

But because he wished to justify himself, he said to Jesus,  
"And who is my neighbor?"  
Jesus replied,  
"A man fell victim to robbers  
as he went down from Jerusalem to Jericho.  
They stripped and beat him and went off leaving him half-dead.  
A priest happened to be going down that road,  
but when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.  
Likewise a Levite came to the place,  
and when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.  
But a Samaritan traveler who came upon him  
was moved with compassion at the sight.  
He approached the victim,  
poured oil and wine over his wounds and bandaged them.  
Then he lifted him up on his own animal,  
took him to an inn, and cared for him.  
The next day he took out two silver coins  
and gave them to the innkeeper with the instruction,  
'Take care of him.  
If you spend more than what I have given you,  
I shall repay you on my way back.'  
Which of these three, in your opinion,  
was neighbor to the robbers' victim?"  
He answered, "The one who treated him with mercy."  
Jesus said to him, "Go and do likewise."
