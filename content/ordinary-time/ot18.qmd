### &nbsp; Year A

#### First Reading [Isaiah 55:1-3]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Thus says the LORD:  
All you who are thirsty,  
come to the water!  
You who have no money,  
come, receive grain and eat;  
Come, without paying and without cost,  
drink wine and milk!  
Why spend your money for what is not bread;  
your wages for what fails to satisfy?  
Heed me, and you shall eat well,  
you shall delight in rich fare.  
Come to me heedfully,  
listen, that you may have life.  
I will renew with you the everlasting covenant,  
the benefits assured to David.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 145:8-9, 15-16, 17-18]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **The hand of the Lord feeds us; he answers all our needs.**  

The LORD is gracious and merciful,  
&emsp; slow to anger and of great kindness.  
The LORD is good to all  
&emsp; and compassionate toward all his works. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The eyes of all look hopefully to you,  
&emsp; and you give them their food in due season;  
you open your hand  
&emsp; and satisfy the desire of every living thing. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The LORD is just in all his ways  
&emsp; and holy in all his works.  
The LORD is near to all who call upon him,  
&emsp; to all who call upon him in truth. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Romans 8:35, 37-39]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
What will separate us from the love of Christ?  
Will anguish, or distress, or persecution, or famine,  
or nakedness, or peril, or the sword?  
No, in all these things we conquer overwhelmingly  
through him who loved us.  
For I am convinced that neither death, nor life,  
nor angels, nor principalities,  
nor present things, nor future things,  
nor powers, nor height, nor depth,  
nor any other creature will be able to separate us  
from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

#### Gospel Acclamation [Matthew 4:4b]{style="float:right" .small}

**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia, alleluia.**  
One does not live on bread alone,  
but on every word that comes forth from the mouth of God. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Gospel [Matthew 14:13-21]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

When Jesus heard of the death of John the Baptist,  
he withdrew in a boat to a deserted place by himself.  
The crowds heard of this and followed him on foot from their towns.  
When he disembarked and saw the vast crowd,  
his heart was moved with pity for them, and he cured their sick.  
When it was evening, the disciples approached him and said,  
“This is a deserted place and it is already late;  
dismiss the crowds so that they can go to the villages  
and buy food for themselves.”  
Jesus said to them, “There is no need for them to go away;  
give them some food yourselves.”  
But they said to him,  
“Five loaves and two fish are all we have here.”  
Then he said, “Bring them here to me,”  
and he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass.  
Taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven,  
he said the blessing, broke the loaves,  
and gave them to the disciples,  
who in turn gave them to the crowds.  
They all ate and were satisfied,  
and they picked up the fragments left over—  
twelve wicker baskets full.  
Those who ate were about five thousand men,  
not counting women and children.

### &nbsp; Year B

#### First Reading [Exodus 16:2-4, 12-15]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

The whole Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron.  
The Israelites said to them,  
"Would that we had died at the LORD's hand in the land of Egypt,  
as we sat by our fleshpots and ate our fill of bread!  
But you had to lead us into this desert  
to make the whole community die of famine!"  

Then the LORD said to Moses,  
"I will now rain down bread from heaven for you.  
Each day the people are to go out and gather their daily portion;  
thus will I test them,  
to see whether they follow my instructions or not.  

"I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites.  
Tell them: In the evening twilight you shall eat flesh,  
and in the morning you shall have your fill of bread,  
so that you may know that I, the LORD, am your God."  

In the evening quail came up and covered the camp.  
In the morning a dew lay all about the camp,  
and when the dew evaporated, there on the surface of the desert  
were fine flakes like hoarfrost on the ground.  
On seeing it, the Israelites asked one another, "What is this?"  
for they did not know what it was.  
But Moses told them,  
"This is the bread that the LORD has given you to eat."

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 78:3-4, 23-24, 25, 54]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **The Lord gave them bread from heaven.**  

What we have heard and know,  
and what our fathers have declared to us,  
We will declare to the generation to come  
the glorious deeds of the LORD and his strength  
and the wonders that he wrought. **[℟.]{.red}**  

He commanded the skies above  
and opened the doors of heaven;  
he rained manna upon them for food  
and gave them heavenly bread. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Man ate the bread of angels,  
food he sent them in abundance.  
And he brought them to his holy land,  
to the mountains his right hand had won. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Ephesians 4:17, 20-24]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
I declare and testify in the Lord  
that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do,  
in the futility of their minds;  
that is not how you learned Christ,  
assuming that you have heard of him and were taught in him,  
as truth is in Jesus,  
that you should put away the old self of your former way of life,  
corrupted through deceitful desires,  
and be renewed in the spirit of your minds,  
and put on the new self,  
created in God's way in righteousness and holiness of truth.

#### Gospel [John 6:24-35]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

When the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there,  
they themselves got into boats  
and came to Capernaum looking for Jesus.  
And when they found him across the sea they said to him,  
"Rabbi, when did you get here?"  
Jesus answered them and said,  
"Amen, amen, I say to you,  
you are looking for me not because you saw signs  
but because you ate the loaves and were filled.  
Do not work for food that perishes  
but for the food that endures for eternal life,  
which the Son of Man will give you.  
For on him the Father, God, has set his seal."  
So they said to him,  
"What can we do to accomplish the works of God?"  
Jesus answered and said to them,  
"This is the work of God, that you believe in the one he sent."  
So they said to him,  
"What sign can you do, that we may see and believe in you?  
What can you do?  
Our ancestors ate manna in the desert, as it is written:  
*He gave them bread from heaven to eat.*"  
So Jesus said to them,  
"Amen, amen, I say to you,  
it was not Moses who gave the bread from heaven;  
my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.  
For the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven. 
and gives life to the world."  

So they said to him,  
"Sir, give us this bread always."  
Jesus said to them,  
"I am the bread of life;  
whoever comes to me will never hunger,  
and whoever believes in me will never thirst."

### &nbsp; Year C

#### First Reading [Ecclesiastes 1:2; 2:21-23]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Vanity of vanities, says Qoheleth,  
vanity of vanities!  All things are vanity!  

Here is one who has labored with wisdom and knowledge and skill,  
and yet to another who has not labored over it,  
he must leave property.  
This also is vanity and a great misfortune.  
For what profit comes to man from all the toil and anxiety of heart  
with which he has labored under the sun?  
All his days sorrow and grief are his occupation;  
even at night his mind is not at rest.  
This also is vanity.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 90:3-4, 5-6, 12-13, 14, 17]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts.**  

You turn man back to dust,  
saying, “Return, O children of men.”  
For a thousand years in your sight  
are as yesterday, now that it is past,  
or as a watch of the night. **[℟.]{.red}**  

You make an end of them in their sleep;  
the next morning they are like the changing grass,  
Which at dawn springs up anew,  
but by evening wilts and fades. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Teach us to number our days aright,  
that we may gain wisdom of heart.  
Return, O LORD! How long?  
Have pity on your servants! **[℟.]{.red}**  

Fill us at daybreak with your kindness,  
that we may shout for joy and gladness all our days.  
And may the gracious care of the LORD our God be ours;  
prosper the work of our hands for us!  
Prosper the work of our hands! **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Colossians 3:1-5, 9-11]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
If you were raised with Christ, seek what is above,  
where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.  
Think of what is above, not of what is on earth.  
For you have died,  
and your life is hidden with Christ in God.  
When Christ your life appears,  
then you too will appear with him in glory.  

Put to death, then, the parts of you that are earthly:  
immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire,  
and the greed that is idolatry.  
Stop lying to one another,  
since you have taken off the old self with its practices  
and have put on the new self,  
which is being renewed, for knowledge,  
in the image of its creator.  
Here there is not Greek and Jew,  
circumcision and uncircumcision,  
barbarian, Scythian, slave, free;  
but Christ is all and in all.

#### Gospel [Luke 12:13-21]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Someone in the crowd said to Jesus,  
“Teacher, tell my brother to share the inheritance with me.”  
He replied to him,  
“Friend, who appointed me as your judge and arbitrator?”  
Then he said to the crowd,  
“Take care to guard against all greed,  
for though one may be rich,  
one’s life does not consist of possessions.”  

Then he told them a parable.  
“There was a rich man whose land produced a bountiful harvest.  
He asked himself, ‘What shall I do,  
for I do not have space to store my harvest?’  
And he said, ‘This is what I shall do:  
I shall tear down my barns and build larger ones.  
There I shall store all my grain and other goods  
and I shall say to myself, “Now as for you,  
you have so many good things stored up for many years,  
rest, eat, drink, be merry!”’  
But God said to him,  
‘You fool, this night your life will be demanded of you;  
and the things you have prepared, to whom will they belong?’  
Thus will it be for all who store up treasure for themselves  
but are not rich in what matters to God.”
