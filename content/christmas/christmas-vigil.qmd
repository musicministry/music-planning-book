#### First Reading [Isaiah 62:1-5]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

For Zion’s sake I will not be silent,  
for Jerusalem’s sake I will not be quiet,  
until her vindication shines forth like the dawn  
and her victory like a burning torch.  

Nations shall behold your vindication,  
and all the kings your glory;  
you shall be called by a new name  
pronounced by the mouth of the LORD.  
You shall be a glorious crown in the hand of the LORD,  
a royal diadem held by your God.  
No more shall people call you “Forsaken,”  
or your land “Desolate,”  
but you shall be called “My Delight,”  
and your land “Espoused.”  
For the LORD delights in you  
and makes your land his spouse.  
As a young man marries a virgin,  
your Builder shall marry you;  
and as a bridegroom rejoices in his bride  
so shall your God rejoice in you.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 89:4-5, 16-17, 27, 29]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.**  

I have made a covenant with my chosen one,  
&emsp; I have sworn to David my servant:  
Forever will I confirm your posterity  
&emsp; and establish your throne for all generations. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Blessed the people who know the joyful shout;  
&emsp; in the light of your countenance, O LORD, they walk.  
At your name they rejoice all the day,  
&emsp; and through your justice they are exalted. **[℟.]{.red}**  

He shall say of me, “You are my father,  
&emsp; my God, the rock, my savior.”  
Forever I will maintain my kindness toward him,  
&emsp; and my covenant with him stands firm. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Acts 13:16-17, 22-25]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

When Paul reached Antioch in Pisidia and entered the synagogue,  
he stood up, motioned with his hand, and said,  
“Fellow Israelites and you others who are God-fearing, listen.  
The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors  
and exalted the people during their sojourn in the  
land of Egypt.  
With uplifted arm he led them out of it.  
Then he removed Saul and raised up David as king;  
of him he testified,  
‘I have found David, son of Jesse, a man after my own heart;  
he will carry out my every wish.’  
From this man’s descendants God, according to his promise,  
has brought to Israel a savior, Jesus.  
John heralded his coming by proclaiming a baptism of repentance  
to all the people of Israel;  
and as John was completing his course, he would say,  
‘What do you suppose that I am?  I am not he.  
Behold, one is coming after me;  
I am not worthy to unfasten the sandals of his feet.’”

#### Gospel [Matthew 1:1-25 or 1:18-25]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ,  
the son of David, the son of Abraham.  

Abraham became the father of Isaac,  
Isaac the father of Jacob,  
Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers.  
Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah,  
whose mother was Tamar.  
Perez became the father of Hezron,  
Hezron the father of Ram,  
Ram the father of Amminadab.  
Amminadab became the father of Nahshon,  
Nahshon the father of Salmon,  
Salmon the father of Boaz,  
whose mother was Rahab.  
Boaz became the father of Obed,  
whose mother was Ruth.  
Obed became the father of Jesse,  
Jesse the father of David the king.  

David became the father of Solomon,  
whose mother had been the wife of Uriah.  
Solomon became the father of Rehoboam,  
Rehoboam the father of Abijah,  
Abijah the father of Asaph.  
Asaph became the father of Jehoshaphat,  
Jehoshaphat the father of Joram,  
Joram the father of Uzziah.  
Uzziah became the father of Jotham,  
Jotham the father of Ahaz,  
Ahaz the father of Hezekiah.  
Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh,  
Manasseh the father of Amos,  

Amos the father of Josiah.  
Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers  
at the time of the Babylonian exile.  

After the Babylonian exile,  
Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel,  
Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,  
Zerubbabel the father of Abiud.  
Abiud became the father of Eliakim,  
Eliakim the father of Azor,  
Azor the father of Zadok.  
Zadok became the father of Achim,  
Achim the father of Eliud,  
Eliud the father of Eleazar.  
Eleazar became the father of Matthan,  
Matthan the father of Jacob,  
Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary.  
Of her was born Jesus who is called the Christ.  

Thus the total number of generations  
from Abraham to David  
is fourteen generations;  
from David to the Babylonian exile,  
fourteen generations;  
from the Babylonian exile to the Christ,  
fourteen generations.  

Now this is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about.  
When his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph,  
but before they lived together,  
she was found with child through the Holy Spirit.  
Joseph her husband, since he was a righteous man,  
yet unwilling to expose her to shame,  
decided to divorce her quietly.  
Such was his intention when, behold,  
the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said,  
“Joseph, son of David,  
do not be afraid to take Mary your wife into your home.  
For it is through the Holy Spirit  
that this child has been conceived in her.  
She will bear a son and you are to name him Jesus,  
because he will save his people from their sins.”  
All this took place to fulfill  
what the Lord had said through the prophet:  
*Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son*,  
*and they shall name him Emmanuel*,  
which means “God is with us.”  
When Joseph awoke,  
he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him  
and took his wife into his home.  
He had no relations with her until she bore a son,  
and he named him Jesus.
