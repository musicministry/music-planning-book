The [Christmas Carol Mass](https://kevinweed.com/christmas-carol-mass/) puts the texts of the Mass to the tunes of familiar Christmas carols, making it easy to learn and sing. It oï¬€ers an opportunity to increase the use of popular melodies during the short Christmas season. The Mass setting includes options for the [Memorial Acclamation]{.black} and the [Great Amen]{.black}; the preferred version for each is provided here:

```{python}
#| title: Year ABC
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
utils.masssetting(params['mass']['abc'], urls=videos)
```

::: {.red}
(This setting is not currently available through any of the three major publishers. It will need to be purchased for public liturgical use [here](https://kevinweed.com/christmas-carol-mass/).)

Alternatively, the Mass parts during the season of Christmas can be taken from the appropriate [Liturgical Cycle](../ordinary-time/ot.qmd), using the [Christmas Gloria]{.black} instead of the Gloria from the Mass setting.
