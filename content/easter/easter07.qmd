#### First Reading [Acts 1:12-14]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

After Jesus had been taken up to heaven the apostles  
returned to Jerusalem  
from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem,  
a sabbath day’s journey away.  

When they entered the city  
they went to the upper room where they were staying,  
Peter and John and James and Andrew,  
Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew,  
James son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot,  
and Judas son of James.  
All these devoted themselves with one accord to prayer,  
together with some women,  
and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.

**[℟.]{.red}** **I believe that I shall see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living.**  
[Or:]{.red}  
**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia.**  

The LORD is my light and my salvation;  
whom should I fear?  
The LORD is my life’s refuge;  
of whom should I be afraid? **[℟.]{.red}**  

One thing I ask of the LORD;  
this I seek:  
To dwell in the house of the LORD  
all the days of my life,  
That I may gaze on the loveliness of the LORD  
and contemplate his temple. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Hear, O Lord, the sound of my call;  
have pity on me, and answer me.  
Of you my heart speaks; you my glance seeks. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [1 Peter 4:13-16]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Beloved:  
Rejoice to the extent that you share in the sufferings of Christ,  
so that when his glory is revealed  
you may also rejoice exultantly.  
If you are insulted for the name of Christ, blessed are you,  
for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.  
But let no one among you be made to suffer  
as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as an intriguer.  
But whoever is made to suffer as a Christian should not be ashamed  
but glorify God because of the name.

#### Gospel [John 17:1-11a]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus raised his eyes to heaven and said,  
“Father, the hour has come.  
Give glory to your son, so that your son may glorify you,  
just as you gave him authority over all people,  
so that your son may give eternal life to all you gave him.  
Now this is eternal life,  
that they should know you, the only true God,  
and the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.  
I glorified you on earth  
by accomplishing the work that you gave me to do.  
Now glorify me, Father, with you,  
with the glory that I had with you before the world began.  

“I revealed your name to those whom you gave me out of the world.  
They belonged to you, and you gave them to me,  
and they have kept your word.  
Now they know that everything you gave me is from you,  
because the words you gave to me I have given to them,  
and they accepted them and truly understood that I came from you,  
and they have believed that you sent me.  
I pray for them.  
I do not pray for the world but for the ones you have given me,  
because they are yours, and everything of mine is yours  
and everything of yours is mine,  
and I have been glorified in them.  
And now I will no longer be in the world,  
but they are in the world, while I am coming to you.”

#### First Reading [Acts 1:15-17, 20a, 20c-26]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Peter stood up in the midst of the brothers  
—there was a group of about one hundred and twenty persons  
in the one place.  
He said, “My brothers,  
the Scripture had to be fulfilled  
which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand  
through the mouth of David, concerning Judas,  
who was the guide for those who arrested Jesus.  
He was numbered among us  
and was allotted a share in this ministry.  

“For it is written in the Book of Psalms:  
*May another take his office.*  

“Therefore, it is necessary that one of the men  
who accompanied us the whole time  
the Lord Jesus came and went among us,  
beginning from the baptism of John  
until the day on which he was taken up from us,  
become with us a witness to his resurrection.”  
So they proposed two, Judas called Barsabbas,  
who was also known as Justus, and Matthias.  
Then they prayed,  
“You, Lord, who know the hearts of all,  
show which one of these two you have chosen  
to take the place in this apostolic ministry  
from which Judas turned away to go to his own place.”  
Then they gave lots to them, and the lot fell upon Matthias,  
and he was counted with the eleven apostles.

:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **The Lord has set his throne in heaven.**  
[Or:]{.red}  
**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia.**  

Bless the LORD, O my soul;  
and all my being, bless his holy name.  
Bless the LORD, O my soul,  
and forget not all his benefits. **[℟.]{.red}**  

For as the heavens are high above the earth,  
so surpassing is his kindness toward those who fear him.  
As far as the east is from the west,  
so far has he put our transgressions from us. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The LORD has established his throne in heaven,  
and his kingdom rules over all.  
Bless the LORD, all you his angels,  
you mighty in strength, who do his bidding. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [1 John 4:11-16]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Beloved, if God so loved us,  
we also must love one another.  
No one has ever seen God.  
Yet, if we love one another, God remains in us,  
and his love is brought to perfection in us.  

This is how we know that we remain in him and he in us,  
that he has given us of his Spirit.  
Moreover, we have seen and testify  
that the Father sent his Son as savior of the world.  
Whoever acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God,  
God remains in him and he in God.  
We have come to know and to believe in the love God has for us.  

God is love, and whoever remains in love  
remains in God and God in him.

#### Gospel [John 17:11b-19]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Lifting up his eyes to heaven, Jesus prayed saying:  
“Holy Father, keep them in your name that you have given me,  
so that they may be one just as we are one.  
When I was with them I protected them in your name that you gave me,  
and I guarded them, and none of them was lost  
except the son of destruction,  
in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled.  
But now I am coming to you.  
I speak this in the world  
so that they may share my joy completely.  
I gave them your word, and the world hated them,  
because they do not belong to the world  
any more than I belong to the world.  
I do not ask that you take them out of the world  
but that you keep them from the evil one.  
They do not belong to the world  
any more than I belong to the world.  
Consecrate them in the truth. Your word is truth.  
As you sent me into the world,  
so I sent them into the world.  
And I consecrate myself for them,  
so that they also may be consecrated in truth.”

#### First Reading [Acts 7:55-60]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Stephen, filled with the Holy Spirit,  
looked up intently to heaven and saw the glory of God  
and Jesus standing at the right hand of God,  
and Stephen said, “Behold, I see the heavens opened  
and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.”  
But they cried out in a loud voice,  
covered their ears, and rushed upon him together.  
They threw him out of the city, and began to stone him.  
The witnesses laid down their cloaks  
at the feet of a young man named Saul.  
As they were stoning Stephen, he called out,  
“Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.”  
Then he fell to his knees and cried out in a loud voice,  
“Lord, do not hold this sin against them;”  
and when he said this, he fell asleep.

**[℟.]{.red}** **The Lord is king, the most high over all the earth.**  
[Or:]{.red}  
**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia.**  

The LORD is king; let the earth rejoice;  
&emsp; let the many islands be glad.  
Justice and judgment are the foundation of his throne. **[℟.]{.red}**  

The heavens proclaim his justice,  
&emsp; and all peoples see his glory.  
All gods are prostrate before him. **[℟.]{.red}**  

You, O LORD, are the Most High over all the earth,  
&emsp; exalted far above all gods. **[℟.]{.red}**

:::

I, John, heard a voice saying to me:  
“Behold, I am coming soon.  
I bring with me the recompense I will give to each  
according to his deeds.  
I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last,  
the beginning and the end.”  

Blessed are they who wash their robes  
so as to have the right to the tree of life  
and enter the city through its gates.  

“I, Jesus, sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches.  
I am the root and offspring of David,  
the bright morning star.”  

The Spirit and the bride say, “Come.”  
Let the hearer say, “Come.”  
Let the one who thirsts come forward,  
and the one who wants it receive the gift of life-giving water.  

The one who gives this testimony says, “Yes, I am coming soon.”  
Amen!  Come, Lord Jesus!

Lifting up his eyes to heaven, Jesus prayed saying:  
“Holy Father, I pray not only for them,  
but also for those who will believe in me through their word,  
so that they may all be one,  
as you, Father, are in me and I in you,  
that they also may be in us,  
that the world may believe that you sent me.  
And I have given them the glory you gave me,  
so that they may be one, as we are one,  
I in them and you in me,  
that they may be brought to perfection as one,  
that the world may know that you sent me,  
and that you loved them even as you loved me.  
Father, they are your gift to me.  
I wish that where I am they also may be with me,  
that they may see my glory that you gave me,  
because you loved me before the foundation of the world.  
Righteous Father, the world also does not know you,  
but I know you, and they know that you sent me.  
I made known to them your name and I will make it known,  
that the love with which you loved me  
may be in them and I in them.”

### Notes
:::

* In most United States dioceses, the Solemnity of the Ascension is transferred to---and replaces-–-the Seventh Sunday of Easter. In this scenario, the Solemnity of the Ascension takes priority and the hymns for the Solemnity are used. The Seventh Sunday of Easter is then skipped; the following weekend is Pentecost Sunday.
