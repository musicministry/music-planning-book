#### First Reading [Acts 2:14, 22-33]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Then Peter stood up with the Eleven,  
raised his voice, and proclaimed:  
"You who are Jews, indeed all of you staying in Jerusalem.  
Let this be known to you, and listen to my words.  
You who are Israelites, hear these words.  
Jesus the Nazarene was a man commended to you by God  
with mighty deeds, wonders, and signs,  
which God worked through him in your midst, as you yourselves know.  
This man, delivered up by the set plan and foreknowledge of God,  
you killed, using lawless men to crucify him.  
But God raised him up, releasing him from the throes of death,  
because it was impossible for him to be held by it.  
For David says of him:  
*I saw the Lord ever before me,*  
*with him at my right hand I shall not be disturbed.*  
*Therefore my heart has been glad and my tongue has exulted;*  
*my flesh, too, will dwell in hope,*  
*because you will not abandon my soul to the netherworld,*  
*nor will you suffer your holy one to see corruption.*  
*You have made known to me the paths of life;*  
*you will fill me with joy in your presence.*  

"My brothers, one can confidently say to you  
about the patriarch David that he died and was buried,  
and his tomb is in our midst to this day.  
But since he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn an oath to him  
that he would set one of his descendants upon his throne,  
he foresaw and spoke of the resurrection of the Christ,  
that neither was he abandoned to the netherworld  
nor did his flesh see corruption.  
God raised this Jesus;  
of this we are all witnesses.  
Exalted at the right hand of God,  
he received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father  
and poured him forth, as you see and hear."

**[℟.]{.red}** **Lord, you will show us the path of life.**

**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia.**  

Keep me, O God, for in you I take refuge;  
I say to the LORD, "My Lord are you."  
O LORD, my allotted portion and my cup,  
you it is who hold fast my lot. **[℟.]{.red}**  

I bless the LORD who counsels me;  
even in the night my heart exhorts me.  
I set the LORD ever before me;  
with him at my right hand I shall not be disturbed. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Therefore my heart is glad and my soul rejoices,  
my body, too, abides in confidence;  
because you will not abandon my soul to the netherworld,  
nor will you suffer your faithful one to undergo corruption. **[℟.]{.red}**  

You will show me the path to life,  
abounding joy in your presence,  
the delights at your right hand forever. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [1 Peter 1:17-21]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Beloved:  
If you invoke as Father him who judges impartially  
according to each one's works,  
conduct yourselves with reverence during the time of your sojourning,  
realizing that you were ransomed from your futile conduct,  
handed on by your ancestors,  
not with perishable things like silver or gold  
but with the precious blood of Christ  
as of a spotless unblemished lamb.  

He was known before the foundation of the world  
but revealed in the final time for you,  
who through him believe in God  
who raised him from the dead and gave him glory,  
so that your faith and hope are in God.

#### Gospel [Luke 24:13-35]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

That very day, the first day of the week,  
two of Jesus' disciples were going  
to a village seven miles from Jerusalem called Emmaus,  
and they were conversing about all the things that had occurred.  
And it happened that while they were conversing and debating,  
Jesus himself drew near and walked with them,  
but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him.  
He asked them,   
"What are you discussing as you walk along?"  
They stopped, looking downcast.  
One of them, named Cleopas, said to him in reply,  
"Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem  
who does not know of the things  
that have taken place there in these days?"  
And he replied to them, "What sort of things?"  
They said to him,  
"The things that happened to Jesus the Nazarene,  
who was a prophet mighty in deed and word  
before God and all the people,  
how our chief priests and rulers both handed him over  
to a sentence of death and crucified him.  
But we were hoping that he would be the one to redeem Israel;  
and besides all this,  
it is now the third day since this took place.  
Some women from our group, however, have astounded us:  
they were at the tomb early in the morning  
and did not find his body;  
they came back and reported  
that they had indeed seen a vision of angels  
who announced that he was alive.  
Then some of those with us went to the tomb  
and found things just as the women had described,  
but him they did not see."  
And he said to them, "Oh, how foolish you are!  
How slow of heart to believe all that the prophets spoke!  
Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things  
and enter into his glory?"  
Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets,  
he interpreted to them what referred to him  
in all the Scriptures.  
As they approached the village to which they were going,  
he gave the impression that he was going on farther.  
But they urged him, "Stay with us,  
for it is nearly evening and the day is almost over."  
So he went in to stay with them.  
And it happened that, while he was with them at table,  
he took bread, said the blessing,  
broke it, and gave it to them.  
With that their eyes were opened and they recognized him,  
but he vanished from their sight.  
Then they said to each other,  
"Were not our hearts burning within us  
while he spoke to us on the way and opened the Scriptures to us?"  
So they set out at once and returned to Jerusalem  
where they found gathered together  
the eleven and those with them who were saying,  
"The Lord has truly been raised and has appeared to Simon!"  
Then the two recounted  
what had taken place on the way  
and how he was made known to them in the breaking of bread.

#### First Reading [Acts 3:13-15, 17-19]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Peter said to the people:  
"The God of Abraham,  
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,  
the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus,  
whom you handed over and denied in Pilate's presence  
when he had decided to release him.  
You denied the Holy and Righteous One  
and asked that a murderer be released to you.  
The author of life you put to death,  
but God raised him from the dead; of this we are witnesses.  
Now I know, brothers,  
that you acted out of ignorance, just as your leaders did;  
but God has thus brought to fulfillment  
what he had announced beforehand  
through the mouth of all the prophets,  
that his Christ would suffer.  
Repent, therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be wiped away."

When I call, answer me, O my just God,  
you who relieve me when I am in distress;  
have pity on me, and hear my prayer! **[℟.]{.red}**  

Know that the LORD does wonders for his faithful one;  
the LORD will hear me when I call upon him. **[℟.]{.red}**  

O LORD, let the light of your countenance shine upon us!  
You put gladness into my heart. **[℟.]{.red}**  

As soon as I lie down, I fall peacefully asleep,  
for you alone, O LORD,  
bring security to my dwelling. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [1 John 2:1-5a]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

My children, I am writing this to you  
so that you may not commit sin.  
But if anyone does sin, we have an Advocate with the Father,  
Jesus Christ the righteous one.  
He is expiation for our sins,  
and not for our sins only but for those of the whole world.  
The way we may be sure that we know him is to keep  
his commandments.  
Those who say, "I know him," but do not keep his commandments  
are liars, and the truth is not in them.  
But whoever keeps his word,  
the love of God is truly perfected in him.

:::

The two disciples recounted what had taken place on the way,  
and how Jesus was made known to them  
in the breaking of bread.  

While they were still speaking about this,  
he stood in their midst and said to them,  
"Peace be with you."  
But they were startled and terrified  
and thought that they were seeing a ghost.  
Then he said to them, "Why are you troubled?  
And why do questions arise in your hearts?  
Look at my hands and my feet, that it is I myself.  
Touch me and see, because a ghost does not have flesh and bones  
as you can see I have."  
And as he said this,  
he showed them his hands and his feet.  
While they were still incredulous for joy and were amazed,  
he asked them, "Have you anything here to eat?"  
They gave him a piece of baked fish;  
he took it and ate it in front of them.  

He said to them,  
"These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you,  
that everything written about me in the law of Moses  
and in the prophets and psalms must be fulfilled."  
Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.  
And he said to them,  
"Thus it is written that the Christ would suffer  
and rise from the dead on the third day  
and that repentance, for the forgiveness of sins,  
would be preached in his name  
to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.  
You are witnesses of these things."

#### First Reading [Acts 5:27-32, 40b-41]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

When the captain and the court officers had brought the apostles in  
and made them stand before the Sanhedrin,  
the high priest questioned them,  
“We gave you strict orders, did we not,  
to stop teaching in that name?  
Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching  
and want to bring this man’s blood upon us.”  
But Peter and the apostles said in reply,  
“We must obey God rather than men.  
The God of our ancestors raised Jesus,  
though you had him killed by hanging him on a tree.  
God exalted him at his right hand as leader and savior  
to grant Israel repentance and forgiveness of sins.  
We are witnesses of these things,  
as is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him.”  

The Sanhedrin ordered the apostles  
to stop speaking in the name of Jesus, and dismissed them.  
So they left the presence of the Sanhedrin,  
rejoicing that they had been found worthy  
to suffer dishonor for the sake of the name.

**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia.**

I will extol you, O LORD, for you drew me clear  
&emsp; and did not let my enemies rejoice over me.  
O LORD, you brought me up from the netherworld;  
&emsp; you preserved me from among those going down into the pit. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Sing praise to the LORD, you his faithful ones,  
&emsp; and give thanks to his holy name.  
For his anger lasts but a moment;  
&emsp; a lifetime, his good will.  
At nightfall, weeping enters in,  
&emsp; but with the dawn, rejoicing. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Hear, O LORD, and have pity on me;  
&emsp; O LORD, be my helper.  
You changed my mourning into dancing;  
&emsp; O LORD, my God, forever will I give you thanks. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Revelation 5:11-14]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

I, John, looked and heard the voices of many angels  
who surrounded the throne  
and the living creatures and the elders.  
They were countless in number, and they cried out in a loud voice:  
&emsp; “Worthy is the Lamb that was slain  
&emsp; &emsp; to receive power and riches, wisdom and strength,  
&emsp; &emsp; honor and glory and blessing.”  
Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth  
and under the earth and in the sea,  
everything in the universe, cry out:  
&emsp; “To the one who sits on the throne and to the Lamb  
&emsp; &emsp; be blessing and honor, glory and might,  
&emsp; &emsp; forever and ever.”  
The four living creatures answered, “Amen,“  
and the elders fell down and worshiped.

:::

At that time, Jesus revealed himself again to his disciples at the Sea of Tiberias.  
He revealed himself in this way.  
Together were Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus,  
Nathanael from Cana in Galilee,  
Zebedee’s sons, and two others of his disciples.  
Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing.”  
They said to him, “We also will come with you.”  
So they went out and got into the boat,  
but that night they caught nothing.  
When it was already dawn, Jesus was standing on the shore;  
but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.  
Jesus said to them, “Children, have you caught anything to eat?”  
They answered him, “No.”  
So he said to them, “Cast the net over the right side of the boat  
and you will find something.”  
So they cast it, and were not able to pull it in  
because of the number of fish.  
So the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord.”  
When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord,  
he tucked in his garment, for he was lightly clad,  
and jumped into the sea.  
The other disciples came in the boat,  
for they were not far from shore, only about a hundred yards,  
dragging the net with the fish.  
When they climbed out on shore,  
they saw a charcoal fire with fish on it and bread.  
Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish you just caught.”  
So Simon Peter went over and dragged the net ashore  
full of one hundred fifty-three large fish.  
Even though there were so many, the net was not torn.  
Jesus said to them, “Come, have breakfast.”  
And none of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are you?”  
because they realized it was the Lord.  
Jesus came over and took the bread and gave it to them,  
and in like manner the fish.  
This was now the third time Jesus was revealed to his disciples  
after being raised from the dead.  

When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter,  
“Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?”  
Simon Peter answered him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”  
Jesus said to him, “Feed my lambs.”  
He then said to Simon Peter a second time,  
“Simon, son of John, do you love me?”  
Simon Peter answered him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”  
Jesus said to him, “Tend my sheep.”  
Jesus said to him the third time,  
“Simon, son of John, do you love me?”  
Peter was distressed that Jesus had said to him a third time,  
“Do you love me?” and he said to him,  
“Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.”  
Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep.  
Amen, amen, I say to you, when you were younger,  
you used to dress yourself and go where you wanted;  
but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands,  
and someone else will dress you  
and lead you where you do not want to go.”  
He said this signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God.  
And when he had said this, he said to him, “Follow me.”
