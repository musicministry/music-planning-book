### Notes
:::

* In many dioceses, the Solemnity of the Ascension is transferred to---and
replaces-â€“-the Seventh Sunday of Easter. In this scenario, the Solemnity of the Ascension takes priority and the hymns for the Solemnity are used. The Seventh Sunday of Easter is then skipped; the following weekend is Pentecost Sunday.
