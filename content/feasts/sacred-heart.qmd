#### First Reading [Deuteronomy 7:6-11]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Moses said to the people:  
"You are a people sacred to the LORD, your God;  
he has chosen you from all the nations on the face of the earth  
to be a people peculiarly his own.  
It was not because you are the largest of all nations  
that the LORD set his heart on you and chose you,  
for you are really the smallest of all nations.  
It was because the LORD loved you  
and because of his fidelity to the oath he had sworn your fathers,  
that he brought you out with his strong hand  
from the place of slavery,  
and ransomed you from the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.  
Understand, then, that the LORD, your God, is God indeed,  
the faithful God who keeps his merciful covenant  
down to the thousandth generation. 
toward those who love him and keep his commandments,  
but who repays with destruction a person who hates him;  
he does not dally with such a one,  
but makes them personally pay for it.  
You shall therefore carefully observe the commandments,  
the statutes and the decrees that I enjoin on you today."

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 103:1-2, 3-4, 6-7, 8, 10]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **The Lord's kindness is everlasting to those who fear him.**  

Bless the LORD, O my soul;  
all my being, bless his holy name.  
Bless the LORD, O my soul;  
and forget not all his benefits. **[℟.]{.red}**  

He pardons all your iniquities,  
heals all your ills.  
He redeems your life from destruction,  
crowns you with kindness and compassion. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Merciful and gracious is the LORD,  
slow to anger and abounding in kindness.  
Not according to our sins does he deal with us,  
nor does he requite us according to our crimes. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [1 John 4:7-16]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Beloved, let us love one another,  
because love is of God;  
everyone who loves is begotten by God and knows God.  
Whoever is without love does not know God, for God is love.  
In this way the love of God was revealed to us:  
God sent his only Son into the world  
so that we might have life through him.  
In this is love:  
not that we have loved God, but that he loved us  
and sent his Son as expiation for our sins.  
Beloved, if God so loved us,  
we also must love one another.  
No one has ever seen God.  
Yet, if we love one another, God remains in us,  
and his love is brought to perfection in us.  

This is how we know that we remain in him and he in us,  
that he has given us of his Spirit.  
Moreover, we have seen and testify  
that the Father sent his Son as savior of the world.  
Whoever acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God,  
God remains in him and he in God.  
We have come to know and to believe in the love God has for us.  

God is love, and whoever remains in love  
remains in God and God in him.

**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia, alleluia.**  
Take my yoke upon you, says the Lord;  
and learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Gospel [Matthew 11:25-30]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

At that time Jesus exclaimed:  
"I give praise to you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,  
for although you have hidden these things  
from the wise and the learned  
you have revealed them to little ones.  
Yes, Father, such has been your gracious will.  
All things have been handed over to me by my Father.  
No one knows the Son except the Father,  
and no one knows the Father except the Son  
and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal him.  

"Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened,  
and I will give you rest.  
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,  
for I am meek and humble of heart;  
and you will find rest for yourselves.  
For my yoke is easy, and my burden light."

#### First Reading [Hosea 11:1, 3-4, 8c-9]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Thus says the LORD:  
When Israel was a child I loved him,  
out of Egypt I called my son.  
Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk,  
who took them in my arms;  
I drew them with human cords,  
with bands of love;  
I fostered them like one  
who raises an infant to his cheeks;  
Yet, though I stooped to feed my child,  
they did not know that I was their healer.  

My heart is overwhelmed,  
my pity is stirred.  
I will not give vent to my blazing anger,  
I will not destroy Ephraim again;  
For I am God and not a man,  
the Holy One present among you;  
I will not let the flames consume you.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Isaiah 12:2-3, 4, 5-6]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **You will draw water joyfully from the springs of salvation.**  

God indeed is my savior;  
I am confident and unafraid.  
My strength and my courage is the LORD,  
and he has been my savior.  
With joy you will draw water  
at the fountain of salvation. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Give thanks to the LORD, acclaim his name;  
among the nations make known his deeds,  
proclaim how exalted is his name. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Sing praise to the LORD for his glorious achievement;  
let this be known throughout all the earth.  
Shout with exultation, O city of Zion,  
for great in your midst  
is the Holy One of Israel! **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Ephesians 3:8-12, 14-19]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
To me, the very least of all the holy ones, this grace was given,  
to preach to the Gentiles the inscrutable riches of Christ,  
and to bring to light for all what is the plan of the mystery  
hidden from ages past in God who created all things,  
so that the manifold wisdom of God  
might now be made known through the church  
to the principalities and authorities in the heavens.  
This was according to the eternal purpose  
that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord,  
in whom we have boldness of speech  
and confidence of access through faith in him.  

For this reason I kneel before the Father,  
from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,  
that he may grant you in accord with the riches of his glory  
to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner self,  
and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith;  
that you, rooted and grounded in love,  
may have strength to comprehend with all the holy ones  
what is the breadth and length and height and depth,  
and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge,  
so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.

#### Gospel [John 19:31-37]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Since it was preparation day,  
in order that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath,  
for the sabbath day of that week was a solemn one,  
the Jews asked Pilate that their legs be broken  
and they be taken down.  
So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first  
and then of the other one who was crucified with Jesus.  
But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead,  
they did not break his legs,  
but one soldier thrust his lance into his side,  
and immediately blood and water flowed out.  
An eyewitness has testified, and his testimony is true;  
he knows that he is speaking the truth,  
so that you also may come to believe.  
For this happened so that the Scripture passage might be fulfilled:  
*Not a bone of it will be broken.*  
*And again another passage says:*  
*They will look upon him whom they have pierced.*

#### First Reading [Ezekiel 34:11-16]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Thus says the Lord GOD:  
I myself will look after and tend my sheep.  
As a shepherd tends his flock  
when he finds himself among his scattered sheep,  
so will I tend my sheep.  
I will rescue them from every place where they were scattered  
when it was cloudy and dark.  
I will lead them out from among the peoples  
and gather them from the foreign lands;  
I will bring them back to their own country  
and pasture them upon the mountains of Israel  
in the land's ravines and all its inhabited places.  
In good pastures will I pasture them,  
and on the mountain heights of Israel  
shall be their grazing ground.  
There they shall lie down on good grazing ground,  
and in rich pastures shall they be pastured  
on the mountains of Israel.  
I myself will pasture my sheep;  
I myself will give them rest, says the Lord GOD.  
The lost I will seek out,  
the strayed I will bring back,  
the injured I will bind up,  
the sick I will heal,  
but the sleek and the strong I will destroy,  
shepherding them rightly.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 23:1-3a, 3b-4, 5, 6]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.**  

The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.  
&emsp; In verdant pastures he gives me repose;  
beside restful waters he leads me;  
&emsp; he refreshes my soul. **[℟.]{.red}**  

He guides me in right paths  
&emsp; for his name's sake.  
Even though I walk in the dark valley  
&emsp; I fear no evil; for you are at my side  
with your rod and your staff  
&emsp; that give me courage. **[℟.]{.red}**  

You spread the table before me  
&emsp; in the sight of my foes;  
you anoint my head with oil;  
&emsp; my cup overflows. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Only goodness and kindness follow me  
&emsp; all the days of my life;  
and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD  
&emsp; for years to come. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Romans 5:5b-11]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Brothers and sisters:  
The love of God has been poured out into our hearts  
through the Holy Spirit that has been given to us.  
For Christ, while we were still helpless,  
died at the appointed time for the ungodly.  
Indeed, only with difficulty does one die for a just person,  
though perhaps for a good person  
one might even find courage to die.  
But God proves his love for us  
in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us.  
How much more then, since we are now justified by his blood,  
will we be saved through him from the wrath.  
Indeed, if, while we were enemies,  
we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son,  
how much more, once reconciled,  
will we be saved by his life.  
Not only that,  
but we also boast of God through our Lord Jesus Christ,  
through whom we have now received reconciliation.

#### Gospel [Luke 15:3-7]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus addressed this parable to the Pharisees and scribes:  
"What man among you having a hundred sheep and losing one of them  
would not leave the ninety-nine in the desert  
and go after the lost one until he finds it?  
And when he does find it,  
he sets it on his shoulders with great joy  
and, upon his arrival home,  
he calls together his friends and neighbors and says to them,  
'Rejoice with me because I have found my lost sheep.'  
I tell you, in just the same way  
there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents  
than over ninety-nine righteous people  
who have no need of repentance."
