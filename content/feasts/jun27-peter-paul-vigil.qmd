#### First Reading [Acts 3:1-10]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Peter and John were going up to the temple area  
for the three o’clock hour of prayer.  
And a man crippled from birth was carried  
and placed at the gate of the temple called “the Beautiful Gate”  
every day to beg for alms from the people who entered the temple.  
When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple,  
he asked for alms.  
But Peter looked intently at him, as did John,  
and said, “Look at us.”  
He paid attention to them, expecting to receive something from them.  
Peter said, “I have neither silver nor gold,  
but what I do have I give you:  
in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazorean, rise and walk.”  
Then Peter took him by the right hand and raised him up,  
and immediately his feet and ankles grew strong.  
He leaped up, stood, and walked around,  
and went into the temple with them,  
walking and jumping and praising God.  
When all the people saw the man walking and praising God,  
they recognized him as the one who used to sit begging  
at the Beautiful Gate of the temple,  
and they were filled with amazement and astonishment  
at what had happened to him.

#### Responsorial Psalm [Psalm 19:2-3, 4-5]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Their message goes out through all the earth.**  

The heavens declare the glory of God;  
and the firmament proclaims his handiwork.  
Day pours out the word to day;  
and night to night imparts knowledge. **[℟.]{.red}**  

Not a word nor a discourse  
whose voice is not heard;  
through all the earth their voice resounds,  
and to the ends of the world, their message. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Second Reading [Galatians 1:11-20]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

I want you to know, brothers and sisters,  
that the Gospel preached by me is not of human origin.  
For I did not receive it from a human being, nor was I taught it,  
but it came through a revelation of Jesus Christ.  

For you heard of my former way of life in Judaism,  
how I persecuted the Church of God beyond measure  
and tried to destroy it, and progressed in Judaism  
beyond many of my contemporaries among my race,  
since I was even more a zealot for my ancestral traditions.  
But when God, who from my mother’s womb had set me apart  
and called me through his grace,  
was pleased to reveal his Son to me,  
so that I might proclaim him to the Gentiles,  
I did not immediately consult flesh and blood,  
nor did I go up to Jerusalem  
to those who were Apostles before me;  
rather, I went into Arabia and then returned to Damascus.  

Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem  
to confer with Cephas and remained with him for fifteen days.  
But I did not see any other of the Apostles,  
only James the brother of the Lord.  
--As to what I am writing to you, behold,  
before God, I am not lying.

#### Gospel Acclamation [John 21:17]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

**[℟.]{.red}** **Alleluia, alleluia.**  
Lord, you know everything:  
you know that I love you. **[℟.]{.red}**

#### Gospel [John 21:15-19]{style="float:right" .small}
:::

Jesus had revealed himself to his disciples  
and, when they had finished breakfast, said to Simon Peter,  
“Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?”  
Simon Peter answered him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”  
Jesus said to him, “Feed my lambs.”  
He then said to Simon Peter a second time,  
“Simon, son of John, do you love me?”  
Simon Peter answered him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”  
He said to him, “Tend my sheep.”  
He said to him the third time,  
“Simon, son of John, do you love me?”  
Peter was distressed that he had said to him a third time,  
“Do you love me?” and he said to him,  
“Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.”  
Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep.  
Amen, amen, I say to you, when you were younger,  
you used to dress yourself and go where you wanted;  
but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands,  
and someone else will dress you  
and lead you where you do not want to go.”  
He said this signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God.  
And when he had said this, he said to him, “Follow me.”

### Notes
:::

* *The first (generic) verse should be sung followed by the special verse for this solemnity.
* The music for the Vigil Mass is the same as for the [Mass During the Day](jun24-nativity-john-baptist.qmd), but the antiphons, readings, and Responsorial Psalm are diﬀerent.
* The **Gloria** is sung or recited. If sung, all Mass parts are taken from the Mass setting for the given year as specified in the [Ordinary Time
preamble](../ordinary-time/ot-summer.qmd).
