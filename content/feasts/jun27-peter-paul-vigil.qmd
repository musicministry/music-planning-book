### Notes
:::

* *The first (generic) verse should be sung followed by the special verse for this solemnity.
* The music for the Vigil Mass is the same as for the [Mass During the Day](jun24-nativity-john-baptist.qmd), but the antiphons, readings, and Responsorial Psalm are diï¬€erent.
* The **Gloria** is sung or recited. If sung, all Mass parts are taken from the Mass setting for the given year as specified in the [Ordinary Time
preamble](../ordinary-time/ordinary-time.qmd).
