### Notes
:::

* *The first (generic) verse should be sung followed by the special verse for this feast.
* The music for the Mass During the Day is the same as for the [Vigil Mass](jun23-nativity-john-baptist-vigil.qmd), but the antiphons, readings, and Responsorial Psalm are diï¬€erent.
* The **Gloria** is sung or recited. If sung, all Mass parts are taken from the Mass setting for the given year as specified in the [Ordinary Time
preamble](../ordinary-time/ot-summer.qmd).
